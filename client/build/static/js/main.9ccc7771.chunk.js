Given the number of diseases to which sitting is linked, and the number of people it apparently kills every year, sitting is one of the worst things we can do for health. But possibly as concerning is the thing that we often do while we're sitting: Mindlessly scrolling through our social media feeds when we have a few spare minutes (or for some, hours). And as we probably know intuitively, and as the research is confirming, it's not the best habit when it comes to our collective psychology. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned about the potential for negative effects of social media in young kids and teens, including cyber-bullying and \"Facebook depression.\" But the same risks may be true for adults, across generations.

The authors conclude that \u201cit may be plausible to speak specifically of \u2018Facebook Addiction Disorder\u2019\u2026because addiction criteria, such as neglect of personal life, mental preoccupation, escapism, mood modifying experiences, tolerance and concealing the addictive behavior, appear to be present in some people who use [social networks] excessively.\u201d (They also found that the motivation for people\u2019s excessive use of social networks differs depending on certain traits\u2014introverts and extroverts use it for different reasons, as do people with narcissistic traits.

Study author Phil Reed said, \u201cWe have known for some time that people who are over-dependent on digital devices report feelings of anxiety when they are stopped from using them, but now we can see that these psychological effects are accompanied by actual physiological changes.\u201d Whether this is true of social media per se is unclear right now, but anecdotal evidence suggests it may be."),o.a.createElement("h3",null,o.a.createElement("strong",null,"It triggers more sadness, less well-being")),o.a.createElement("p",{className:"column"},"The more we use social media, the less happy we seem to be.

The authors suggest this may have to do with the fact that Facebook conjures up a perception of social isolation, in a way that other solitary activities don\u2019t. \u201cOn the surface,\u201d the authors write, \u201cFacebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling such needs by allowing people to instantly connect.

One study looked at how people feel after using Facebook and how they think they\u2019ll feel going in.
