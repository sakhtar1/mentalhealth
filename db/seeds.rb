    title: 'Risk for developing more than one mental health disorder revealed' , content: 'The risk of developing a second mental health disorder after an initial diagnosis is increased, according to new research led by Professor John McGrath from UQs Queensland Brain Institute and Aarhus University.
	Professor McGrath and colleagues looked at Danish health data across a record 5.9 million individuals, providing the largest and most comprehensive study of comorbidity -- the development of two or more mental health disorders.
	This long time frame enabled researchers to track a persons mental health for extended periods of time, and resulted in the startling finding that risk of a second mental health diagnosis remains high, even fifteen years after an initial diagnosis.
	"In the first six months after initial diagnosis, the risk of a second mental health diagnosis is very high: so for example, people diagnosed with mood disorders like depression have a very high risk of being diagnosed with a neurotic disorder like anxiety in the first six months since diagnosis," Professor McGrath said.
	"After the first year this risk drops substantially, but it then stabilises and remains 2 or 3 times higher than those without a prior disorder, even fifteen years after initial diagnosis."
	"Importantly, the result was pervasive -- we found it across all pairs of disorders that we studied."
	The findings also suggest that for some pairs of disorders, it did not matter which one came first -- there was an increased risk of developing the other disorders. For example, an initial diagnosis of depression was just as likely to be followed by a second diagnosis of anxiety, and vice versa.
	Importantly, people who were younger than 20 at the onset of their first mental disorder were significantly more at risk of developing a second disorderover the next 10-15 years, and this vulnerability was found across most pairs of disorders.
	"We found that in younger people, mental health disorders were more "pluripotent", meaning an observed change or disruption in mental health was more flexible in the direction it manifested as a disorder," Professor McGrath said.
	Not only is the study the largest and most comprehensive in its field, but its innovative presentation of results has set a new standard for epidemiology (the study of health and disease data), said Professor McGrath.
	"The paper is open access, with all data available and code free to download, and results presented in an interactive website with educational videos," he said.
	"It is far more user-friendly than the traditional method of presenting results purely in an academic paper."
	"We have provided a detailed, comprehensive atlas of the ways that mental disorders cluster together available openly for public use, and we hope that this informs better practice, better clinical care, and future research."
	The next step for Professor McGrath and his colleagues is to extend the study to identify the risks between mental disorders and the subsequent onset of general medical conditions, such as epilepsy, migraine, heart attacks, and diabetes.
	The paper was published in JAMA Psychiatry and supported by the Danish National Research Foundation.', image: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/326055/pexels-photo-326055.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500', author: 'https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190117090515.htm')

	title: '10 Natural Depression Treatments' , content: 'Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.
	These tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.
	Depression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.
	2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.
	"Start very small," Cook says. "Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day."
	YOU MIGHT LIKE
	As you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.
	3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.
	How much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.
	4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.
	Although nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.
	5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.
	What can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.' ,

	title: "What Is Depression?" , content: 'Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.

	Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:

	Feeling sad or having a depressed mood
	Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed
	Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting
	Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much
	Loss of energy or increased fatigue
	Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)
	Feeling worthless or guilty
	Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions
	Thoughts of death or suicide
	Symptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.

	Also, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.

	Depression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.

	Depression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement
	The death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”

	But being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:

	In grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.
	In grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.
	For some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.
	Risk Factors for Depression
	Depression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.

	Several factors can play a role in depression:

	Biochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.
	Genetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.
	Personality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.
	Environmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.
	How Is Depression Treated?
	Depression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.

	Before a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.

	Medication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.

	Antidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.

	Psychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.

	Psychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.

	Psychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.

	Depending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.

	Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.

	        

	Self-help and Coping
	There are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.

	Depression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.
