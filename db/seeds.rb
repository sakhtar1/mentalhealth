	title: '5 Natural Depression Treatments' , content: 'Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.
	These tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.
	Depression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.
	2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.
	"Start very small," Cook says. "Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day."
	YOU MIGHT LIKE
	As you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.
	3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.
	How much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.
	4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.
	Although nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.
	5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.
	What can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.' ,

	title: "What Is Depression?" , content: 'Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.

	Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:

	Feeling sad or having a depressed mood
	Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed
	Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting
	Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much
	Loss of energy or increased fatigue
	Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)
	Feeling worthless or guilty
	Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions
	Thoughts of death or suicide
	Symptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.

	Also, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.

	Depression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.

	Depression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement
	The death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”

	But being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:

	In grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.
	In grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.
	For some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.
	Risk Factors for Depression
	Depression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.

	Several factors can play a role in depression:

	Biochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.
	Genetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.
	Personality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.
	Environmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.
	How Is Depression Treated?
	Depression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.

	Before a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.

	Medication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.

	Antidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.

	Psychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.

	Psychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.

	Psychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.

	Depending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.

	Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.

	        

	Self-help and Coping
	There are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.

	Depression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.

   	title: 'Risk for developing more than one mental health disorder revealed', content: 'The risk of developing a second mental health disorder after an initial diagnosis is increased, according to new research led by Professor John McGrath from UQs Queensland Brain Institute and Aarhus University. Professor McGrath and colleagues looked at Danish health data across a record 5.9
   	 million individuals, providing the largest and most comprehensive study of comorbidity -- 
   	 the development of two or more mental health disorders. 
   	 This long time frame enabled researchers to track a persons mental health for extended 
   	 periods of time, and resulted in the startling finding that risk of a second mental health 
   	 diagnosis remains high, even fifteen years after an initial diagnosis. 
   	 "In the first six months after initial diagnosis, the risk of a second mental health diagnosis 
   	 is very high: so for example, people diagnosed with mood disorders like depression have a 
   	 very high risk of being diagnosed with a neurotic disorder like anxiety in the first 
   	 six months since diagnosis," Professor McGrath said. "After the first year this risk drops 
   	 substantially, but it then stabilises and remains 2 or 3 times higher than those without a 
   	 prior disorder, even fifteen years after initial diagnosis." "Importantly, the result was 
   	 pervasive -- we found it across all pairs of disorders that we studied." The findings 
   	 also suggest that for some pairs of disorders, it did not matter which one came first -- 
   	 there was an increased risk of developing the other disorders. For example, an initial 
   	 diagnosis of depression was just as likely to be followed by a second diagnosis of anxiety, 
   	 and vice versa. Importantly, people who were younger than 20 at the onset of their first 
   	 mental disorder were significantly more at risk of developing a second disorderover the 
   	 next 10-15 years, and this vulnerability was found across most pairs of disorders. "We found 
   	 that in younger people, mental health disorders were more "pluripotent", meaning an observed 
   	 change or disruption in mental health was more flexible in the direction it manifested as a 
   	 disorder," Professor McGrath said. Not only is the study the largest and most

   	 informs better practice, better clinical care, and future research." The next step for Professor
   	 McGrath and his colleagues is to extend the study to identify the risks between mental disorders
   	 and the subsequent onset of general medical conditions, such as epilepsy, migraine, heart 
   	 attacks, and diabetes. The paper was published in JAMA Psychiatry and supported by the Danish

   	title: 'Happiness Hack: 10 Ways to Be Happier Backed by Science', content: '
Happiness is an elusive goal; everyone seems to want it, but if it were easy to attain, the whole world would be happy and we wouldn’t need to keep searching for it. It’s not easy to be happy most of the time, but there are some tips that we can apply to make us happier.

Here are ten scientific ways you can change your life to make your days just a bit more joyful:

1. Do More Physical Exercise
It is one of the most common New Year’s Resolutions, and science has proven why exercise is very important in our life. A study cited in the book: “The Happiness Advantage” also confirmed the importance of exercise on our happiness level.

Basically, this study looks into three groups of depressed patients. These three groups of depressed patients are each treated with medication, exercise, or a combination of the two. Here’s what they found:

“The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate. Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent!”

This study shows that exercise has the biggest effect in reducing depression.

Here’s another study in the Journal of Health Psychology that also found that people who exercised are happier because they feel better about their bodies.

All the evidence has shown that the benefits of exercise include a happy life, so what are you waiting for? Start exercising now. Start small and build a habit of routine exercising, so that you will be happier.

2. Get More Quality Sleep
We spend roughly one third of our lives sleeping, so you cannot underestimate the importance of sleep for the quality of our lifes. Here’s an interesting study in 2011 from BPS Research Digest that shows how sleep affects our happiness. The research found that people who take an afternoon nap are desensitized to negative emotions yet more responsive to positive ones.

This research shows that not only does sleep deprivation cause emotional problems, a sleep boost can bring emotional advantage. In other words, a good quality sleep does make people more positive and overally happier.

3. Put down your cellphone
A study by Kent State University surveyed more than 500 students and found that frequent cellphone use was associated with lower grades, higher anxiety, and reduced happiness.

“It’s likely that people spending more time on devices have less frequent contact with live social networks, and may be more vulnerable to social comparison that leaves them with a sense of emptiness,” says Ramani Durvasula, PhD, licensed clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at California State University in Los Angeles. “And anxiety may be due to the ‘I don’t want to miss out on anything’ effect – seeing everyone else’s social calendar makes it difficult to stay present in their own lives.”

Even Aristotle extolled moderation in all things. Cell phone and technology is no exception. Excessive use of even the best technologies reduces our happiness in meaningful ways. So, put down your cellphone and your happiness level will surely improve.

4. Take More Social Time
Perhaps you have heard about it before, but one of the top five regrets of the dying people is not spending enough time or staying in touch with friends and family. Spending more time with the people we care about is very beneficial to improving our happiness and our overall quality of life.

Dan Gilbert, a Professor of Psychology in Harvard University explains it very well:

“We are happy when we have family, we are happy when we have friends and almost all the other things we think make us happy are actually just ways of getting more family and friends.”

Interestingly, not only that your social relationship can make you happier, it will also make you live a richer life. A study published in the Journal of Socio-Economics used a shadow pricing method and estimates that your relationships are worth around an additional $131,232 a year.

So, just call your cousin who lives in another city and catch up with them on the phone. That will actually make you happier.

5. Spend More Time Outdoors
Shawn Achor, who has lectured at Harvard University and Wharton School of Business, wrote in his book: ”The Happiness Advantage”, that spending as little as 20 minutes outside in a good weather not only boosts positive mood, but also broadens thinking and improves the working memory.

Another study from The London School of Economics and Political Science also supports this claim. It mentioned that being outdoors, near the sea, on a warm, sunny weekend afternoon is the perfect spot for most. In fact, the participants of the study were found to be substantially happier outdoors in all natural environments than they were in urban environments.

If you wonder what’s the best temperature that maximizes our happiness, you will be amazed that a research by the American Meteorological Society found that happiness is maximized at 13.9°C.

6. Help others for two hours per week
You might be surprised to hear this, but spending money on other people (also called “prosocial spending”) boost happiness more than buying things for ourselves.

A 2012 Harvard study gave away some money to participants of the study. Half of them were asked to spend it on buying things for themselves, while the other half was asked to spend the money by buying things for others. Here’s what they found:

“Participants assigned to recall a purchase made for someone else reported feeling significantly happier immediately after this recollection; most importantly, the happier participants felt, the more likely they were to choose to spend a windfall on someone else in the near future. Thus, by providing initial evidence for a positive feedback loop between prosocial spending and well-being, these data offer one potential path to sustainable happiness: prosocial spending increases happiness which in turn encourages prosocial spending.”

No wonder most millionaires and billionaires are very active in philanthropy. Philanthropy has been proven to increase happiness.

Helping others does not always mean you need to spend money; you can also spend your time (for example via volunteering). Here’s a study in Zurich, Switzerland that supports the notion that volunteering is rewarding in terms of higher life satisfaction.

So, how much time should you spend helping others? Buffer Blog has concluded that 100 hours per year (or two hours per week) is the optimal time we should dedicate to helping others, in order to enrich our lives and be happier

7. Meditate
You might have heard that meditation is very important. The truth is, yes, meditation helps you improve focus, clarity, attention span,  calmness, and, you guessed it right, your happiness.

A research team from Massachusetts General Hospital looked at the brain scans of 16 people before and after they participated in an eight-week course in mindfulness meditation. This study concluded that after completing the course, parts of the participants’ brains associated with compassion and self-awareness grew, and parts associated with stress shrank.

So, what are you waiting for? Start meditating now and you will live a happier life.

8. Practice Gratitude
Gratitude is the act of being thankful for simple things in our life. Practicing gratitude has been proven to increase happiness. There’s a study from Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that suggests that a conscious focus on blessings (in other words: practicing gratitude) have emotional and interpersonal benefits. So, be grateful of the every little thing in your life, because there are a lot more people that are not as fortunate as you.

9. Spend money on experience, not things
Everyone knows that money can’t buy happiness per se, but if you’re going to spend money in search of satisfaction, splurge on an experience, not an expensive toy. A study in Psychological Science found that those who tended to spend their money on doing, as opposed to having, were better off in the long run. This effect was chalked up to the perceived superiority of anticipating an experience (like a trip) to anticipating owning an object (like shoes).

10. Practice Your Spirituality Or Faith
Though religion alone isn’t a great predictor of happiness, a study published in Frontiers In Psychology found that those who actively practiced their faith were happier than both those who had a religion but didn’t practice, and those who were non-religious. This isn’t to say that you have to be religious to be happy, but if you DO have theological inclinations, you may want to make spirituality a habit.',

	title: 'To My Sister With Depression: I See You', content:'You suffer from an invisible illness others closest to you can’t — or don’t want to — see. Depression causes you unseen pain and tortures you from the inside out. Your body hurts and your mind is tired and sometimes you just want to quit, and that’s hard for others to understand. But I promise I will try to understand, and try to help you through this. I see you, and I see you’re hurting.

I see you’re lonely, but you are not alone. I am here, and will not leave until you ask me to. What can I do to help? I can offer a listening ear, a hand to hold and a shoulder to cry on. I can show you funny YouTube videos to make you laugh, or encourage you with my favorite uplifting quotes from Pinterest. If you don’t want any of that, if you don’t want to talk, that’s OK. I can make you a cup of tea, turn on Netflix and sit here quietly. But I’m still here.

I see you doubting yourself, but please don’t. You are my sister and part of my heart. You matter, and how you feel is important. You are not unlovable, you are not unwanted. I know you feel like that right now, but that’s the depression talking. You are loved, you are wanted and your life is valuable. You are important to me, and what you’re feeling is valid.

Please don’t doubt yourself; you are loving, you are kind and you are beautiful, whether you are depressed or not.

I see that it’s hard for you to get out of bed today, and that’s OK. But when you do get out of bed, celebrate. It’s the small victories that will help you get through this. Taking a shower and doing the dishes seem daunting, I know. Take your daily tasks one step at a time. Do you need help? Let me do the dishes. Tell me what else you need me to do today. If you need me to, I will encourage you to stay out of bed. If you want to stay in bed today, that’s OK, but try and get out of bed tomorrow.
I see you blaming yourself for how you’re feeling, but it’s not your fault. You’re not choosing to be depressed, depression has chosen you. Being depressed is kind of like having the flu. When you’re sick, you forget how good you felt before. When you’re depressed, you forget what it’s like to be happy. But just like the flu, you will feel better. If you take your medicine, take care of your body and let others help you, you will feel better.

I see you calling your depression a weakness. Depression is not who you are. You are strong, probably stronger than you think, and you are a fighter. All fighters need someone in their corner, and I will be that for you. I will be here to remind you that you are not weak, and help give you the strength you need to fight through this.

During the times you feel small and unable to be seen, I want you to know I see you, and I see your pain. I care about you, and will be with you through this. When others don’t want to listen, I will. When others don’t want to understand, I do. You can look to me for encouragement, comfort and kindness while depression has you in its hold. 
I will do whatever you want, and whatever you need to help you feel better. You are not a burden, and you won’t push me away by feeling how you are feeling. You are the fighter, and I am your coach, ready to get you through this, but not to rush you. Take your time in feeling better, take care of your body and your mind. If you need me, I will be here, and when no one sees you, I see you.',
