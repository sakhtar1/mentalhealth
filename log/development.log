For example, an initial diagnosis of depression was just as likely to be followed by a second diagnosis of anxiety, and vice versa.\n\tImportantly, people who were younger than 20 at the onset of their first mental disorder were significantly more at risk of developing a second disorderover the next 10-15 years, and this vulnerability was found across most pairs of disorders.\n\t\"We found that in younger people, mental health disorders were more \"pluripotent\", meaning an observed change or disruption in mental health was more flexible in the direction it manifested as a disorder,\" Professor McGrath said.\n\tNot only is the study the largest and most comprehensive in its field, but its innovative presentation of results has set a new standard for epidemiology (the study of health and disease data), said Professor McGrath.\n\t\"The paper is open access, with all data available and code free to download, and results presented in an interactive website with educational videos,\" he said.\n\t\"It is far more user-friendly than the traditional method of presenting results purely in an academic paper.\"\n\t\"We have provided a detailed, comprehensive atlas of the ways that mental disorders cluster together available openly for public use, and we hope that this informs better practice, better clinical care, and future research.\"\n\tThe next step for Professor McGrath and his colleagues is to extend the study to identify the risks between mental disorders and the subsequent onset of general medical conditions, such as epilepsy, migraine, heart attacks, and diabetes.\n\tThe paper was published in JAMA Psychiatry and supported by the Danish National Research Foundation."], ["created_at", "2019-01-29 20:54:51.854860"], ["updated_at", "2019-01-29 20:54:51.854860"], ["author", "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190117090515.htm"]]

You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves."], ["created_at", "2019-01-29 20:54:51.858271"], ["updated_at", "2019-01-29 20:54:51.858271"], ["author", "R. Morgan Griffin"]]

Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\n\n\tDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n\tFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\tChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\tLoss of energy or increased fatigue\n\tIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\n\tFeeling worthless or guilty\n\tDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\tThoughts of death or suicide\n\tSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\n\n\tAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\n\n\tDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.\n\n\tDepression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\n\tThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\n\n\tBut being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:\n\n\tIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.\n\tIn grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.\n\tFor some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.\n\tRisk Factors for Depression\n\tDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\n\tSeveral factors can play a role in depression:\n\n\tBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.\n\tGenetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.\n\tPersonality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.\n\tEnvironmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.\n\tHow Is Depression Treated?\n\tDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\n\n\tBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"title"=>"CRISIS & RECOGNITION", "content"=>"Although twenty percent of children and twenty-five percent of adults  have experienced a mental health disorder at some point in their lives, most families are unprepared for the turmoil and stress that can occur when mental illness hits home.   Confusion, sadness, anger and despair are normal responses to the discovery that someone you love has a mental illness.  The good news is that effective treatments exist for even the most serious mental illnesses.  The sooner you recognize that a mental health problem exists and act to treat it, the better the outcomes and prospects for recovery.\n\nSAFETY FIRST.

For example, an initial diagnosis of depression was just as likely to be followed by a second diagnosis of anxiety, and vice versa.\n\tImportantly, people who were younger than 20 at the onset of their first mental disorder were significantly more at risk of developing a second disorderover the next 10-15 years, and this vulnerability was found across most pairs of disorders.\n\t\"We found that in younger people, mental health disorders were more \"pluripotent\", meaning an observed change or disruption in mental health was more flexible in the direction it manifested as a disorder,\" Professor McGrath said.\n\tNot only is the study the largest and most comprehensive in its field, but its innovative presentation of results has set a new standard for epidemiology (the study of health and disease data), said Professor McGrath.\n\t\"The paper is open access, with all data available and code free to download, and results presented in an interactive website with educational videos,\" he said.\n\t\"It is far more user-friendly than the traditional method of presenting results purely in an academic paper.\"\n\t\"We have provided a detailed, comprehensive atlas of the ways that mental disorders cluster together available openly for public use, and we hope that this informs better practice, better clinical care, and future research.\"\n\tThe next step for Professor McGrath and his colleagues is to extend the study to identify the risks between mental disorders and the subsequent onset of general medical conditions, such as epilepsy, migraine, heart attacks, and diabetes.\n\tThe paper was published in JAMA Psychiatry and supported by the Danish National Research Foundation."], ["created_at", "2019-02-05 00:14:10.699352"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-05 00:14:10.699352"], ["author", "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190117090515.htm"], ["image", "https://images.pexels.com/photos/326055/pexels-photo-326055.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500"]]

You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves."], ["created_at", "2019-02-05 00:14:10.702122"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-05 00:14:10.702122"], ["author", "R.

Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\n\n\tDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n\tFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\tChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\tLoss of energy or increased fatigue\n\tIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\n\tFeeling worthless or guilty\n\tDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\tThoughts of death or suicide\n\tSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\n\n\tAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\n\n\tDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.\n\n\tDepression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\n\tThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\n\n\tBut being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:\n\n\tIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.\n\tIn grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.\n\tFor some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.\n\tRisk Factors for Depression\n\tDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\n\tSeveral factors can play a role in depression:\n\n\tBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.\n\tGenetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.\n\tPersonality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.\n\tEnvironmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.\n\tHow Is Depression Treated?\n\tDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\n\n\tBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

For example, an initial diagnosis of depression was just as likely to be followed by a second diagnosis of anxiety, and vice versa.\n\tImportantly, people who were younger than 20 at the onset of their first mental disorder were significantly more at risk of developing a second disorderover the next 10-15 years, and this vulnerability was found across most pairs of disorders.\n\t\"We found that in younger people, mental health disorders were more \"pluripotent\", meaning an observed change or disruption in mental health was more flexible in the direction it manifested as a disorder,\" Professor McGrath said.\n\tNot only is the study the largest and most comprehensive in its field, but its innovative presentation of results has set a new standard for epidemiology (the study of health and disease data), said Professor McGrath.\n\t\"The paper is open access, with all data available and code free to download, and results presented in an interactive website with educational videos,\" he said.\n\t\"It is far more user-friendly than the traditional method of presenting results purely in an academic paper.\"\n\t\"We have provided a detailed, comprehensive atlas of the ways that mental disorders cluster together available openly for public use, and we hope that this informs better practice, better clinical care, and future research.\"\n\tThe next step for Professor McGrath and his colleagues is to extend the study to identify the risks between mental disorders and the subsequent onset of general medical conditions, such as epilepsy, migraine, heart attacks, and diabetes.\n\tThe paper was published in JAMA Psychiatry and supported by the Danish National Research Foundation."], ["created_at", "2019-02-05 00:17:49.607653"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-05 00:17:49.607653"], ["author", "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190117090515.htm"], ["image", "https://images.pexels.com/photos/326055/pexels-photo-326055.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500"]]

You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves."], ["created_at", "2019-02-05 00:17:49.610874"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-05 00:17:49.610874"], ["author", "R.

Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\n\n\tDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n\tFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\tChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\tLoss of energy or increased fatigue\n\tIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\n\tFeeling worthless or guilty\n\tDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\tThoughts of death or suicide\n\tSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\n\n\tAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\n\n\tDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.\n\n\tDepression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\n\tThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\n\n\tBut being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:\n\n\tIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.\n\tIn grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.\n\tFor some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.\n\tRisk Factors for Depression\n\tDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\n\tSeveral factors can play a role in depression:\n\n\tBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.\n\tGenetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.\n\tPersonality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.\n\tEnvironmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.\n\tHow Is Depression Treated?\n\tDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\n\n\tBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"title"=>"6 Ways Social Media Affects Our Mental Health", "content"=>"Health experts love to say that sitting is the new smoking. Given the number of diseases to which sitting is linked, and the number of people it apparently kills every year, sitting is one of the worst things we can do for health. But possibly as concerning is the thing that we often do while we're sitting: Mindlessly scrolling through our social media feeds when we have a few spare minutes (or for some, hours). And as we probably know intuitively, and as the research is confirming, it's not the best habit when it comes to our collective psychology. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned about the potential for negative effects of social media in young kids and teens, including cyber-bullying and \"Facebook depression.\" But the same risks may be true for adults, across generations. Here's a quick run-down of the studies that have shown that social media isn't very good for mental well-being, and in some ways, it can be pretty damaging.\n\nIt’s addictive\nExperts have not been in total agreement on whether internet addiction is a real thing, let alone social media addiction, but there’s some good evidence that both may exist. A review study from Nottingham Trent University looked back over earlier research on the psychological characteristics, personality and social media use. The authors conclude that “it may be plausible to speak specifically of ‘Facebook Addiction Disorder’…because addiction criteria, such as neglect of personal life, mental preoccupation, escapism, mood modifying experiences, tolerance and concealing the addictive behavior, appear to be present in some people who use [social networks] excessively.” (They also found that the motivation for people’s excessive use of social networks differs depending on certain traits—introverts and extroverts use it for different reasons, as do people with narcissistic traits. But that deserves a piece of its own.)\n\nAnd studies have confirmed that people tend to undergo a kind of withdrawal: A study a few years ago from Swansea University found that people experienced the psychological symptoms of withdrawal when they stopped using (this went for all internet use, not just social media). Their recent follow-up study found that when people stop using, they also undergo small but measurable physiological effects. Study author Phil Reed said, “We have known for some time that people who are over-dependent on digital devices report feelings of anxiety when they are stopped from using them, but now we can see that these psychological effects are accompanied by actual physiological changes.” Whether this is true of social media per se is unclear right now, but anecdotal evidence suggests it may be.\n\nIt triggers more sadness, less well-being\nThe more we use social media, the less happy we seem to be. One study a few years ago found that Facebook use was linked to both less moment-to-moment happiness and less life satisfaction—the more people used Facebook in a day, the more these two variables dropped off. The authors suggest this may have to do with the fact that Facebook conjures up a perception of social isolation, in a way that other solitary activities don’t. “On the surface,” the authors write, “Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling such needs by allowing people to instantly connect. Rather than enhancing well-being, as frequent interactions with supportive 'offline' social networks powerfully do, the current findings demonstrate that interacting with Facebook may predict the opposite result for young adults—it may undermine it.”\n\nIn fact, another study found that social media use is linked to greater feelings of social isolation. The team looked at how much people used 11 social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, Snapchat and Reddit, and correlated this with their “perceived social isolation.” Not surprisingly, it turned out that the more time people spent on these sites, the more socially isolated they perceived themselves to be. And perceived social isolation is one of the worst things for us, mentally and physically.\n\nComparing our lives with others is mentally unhealthy\nPart of the reason Facebook makes people feel socially isolated (even though they may not actually be) is the comparison factor. We fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others as we scroll through our feeds, and make judgements about how we measure up. One study looked at how we make comparisons to others posts, in “upward” or “downward” directions—that is, feeling that we’re either better or worse off than our friends. It turned out that both types of comparisons made people feel worse, which is surprising, since in real life, only upward comparisons (feeling another person has it better than you) makes people feel bad. But in the social network world, it seems that any kind of comparison is linked to depressive symptoms.\n\nIt can lead to jealousy—and a vicious cycle\nIt’s no secret that the comparison factor in social media leads to jealousy—most people will admit that seeing other people’s tropical vacations and perfectly behaved kids is envy-inducing. Studies have certainly shown that social media use triggers feelings of jealousy. The authors of one study, looking at jealousy and other negative feelings while using Facebook, wrote that “This magnitude of envy incidents taking place on FB alone is astounding, providing evidence that FB offers a breeding ground for invidious feelings.\n\nThey add that it can become a vicious cycle: feeling jealous can make a person want to make his or her own life look better, and post jealousy-inducing posts of their own, in an endless circle of one-upping and feeling jealous. Another study looked at the connection between envy and depression in Facebook use and, interestingly, discovered that envy mediates the Facebook-depression link. That is, when envy is controlled for, Facebook isn’t so depressing. So it may be the envy that’s largely to blame in the depression-Facebook connection.\n\nWe get caught in the delusion of thinking it will help\nPart of the unhealthy cycle is that we keep coming back to social media, even though it doesn’t make us feel very good. This is probably because of what’s known as a forecasting error: Like a drug, we think getting a fix will help, but it actually makes us feel worse, which comes down to an error in our ability to predict our own response. One study looked at how people feel after using Facebook and how they think they’ll feel going in. Like other studies suggested, the participants in this one almost always felt worse after using it, compared to people engaging in other activities. But a follow-up experiment showed that people generally believed that they’d feel better after using, not worse. Which of course turns out not to be the case at all, and sounds a lot like the pattern in other types of addiction.\n\nMore friends on social doesn’t mean you’re more social\nA couple of years ago, a study found that more friends on social media doesn’t necessarily mean you have a better social life—there seems to be a cap on the number of friends a person’s brain can handle, and it takes actual social interaction (not virtual) to keep up these friendships. So feeling like you’re being social by being on Facebook doesn’t work.

Given the number of diseases to which sitting is linked, and the number of people it apparently kills every year, sitting is one of the worst things we can do for health. But possibly as concerning is the thing that we often do while we're sitting: Mindlessly scrolling through our social media feeds when we have a few spare minutes (or for some, hours). And as we probably know intuitively, and as the research is confirming, it's not the best habit when it comes to our collective psychology. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned about the potential for negative effects of social media in young kids and teens, including cyber-bullying and \"Facebook depression.\" But the same risks may be true for adults, across generations. Here's a quick run-down of the studies that have shown that social media isn't very good for mental well-being, and in some ways, it can be pretty damaging.\n\nIt’s addictive\nExperts have not been in total agreement on whether internet addiction is a real thing, let alone social media addiction, but there’s some good evidence that both may exist. A review study from Nottingham Trent University looked back over earlier research on the psychological characteristics, personality and social media use. The authors conclude that “it may be plausible to speak specifically of ‘Facebook Addiction Disorder’…because addiction criteria, such as neglect of personal life, mental preoccupation, escapism, mood modifying experiences, tolerance and concealing the addictive behavior, appear to be present in some people who use [social networks] excessively.” (They also found that the motivation for people’s excessive use of social networks differs depending on certain traits—introverts and extroverts use it for different reasons, as do people with narcissistic traits. But that deserves a piece of its own.)\n\nAnd studies have confirmed that people tend to undergo a kind of withdrawal: A study a few years ago from Swansea University found that people experienced the psychological symptoms of withdrawal when they stopped using (this went for all internet use, not just social media). Their recent follow-up study found that when people stop using, they also undergo small but measurable physiological effects. Study author Phil Reed said, “We have known for some time that people who are over-dependent on digital devices report feelings of anxiety when they are stopped from using them, but now we can see that these psychological effects are accompanied by actual physiological changes.” Whether this is true of social media per se is unclear right now, but anecdotal evidence suggests it may be.\n\nIt triggers more sadness, less well-being\nThe more we use social media, the less happy we seem to be. One study a few years ago found that Facebook use was linked to both less moment-to-moment happiness and less life satisfaction—the more people used Facebook in a day, the more these two variables dropped off. The authors suggest this may have to do with the fact that Facebook conjures up a perception of social isolation, in a way that other solitary activities don’t. “On the surface,” the authors write, “Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling such needs by allowing people to instantly connect. Rather than enhancing well-being, as frequent interactions with supportive 'offline' social networks powerfully do, the current findings demonstrate that interacting with Facebook may predict the opposite result for young adults—it may undermine it.”\n\nIn fact, another study found that social media use is linked to greater feelings of social isolation. The team looked at how much people used 11 social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, Snapchat and Reddit, and correlated this with their “perceived social isolation.” Not surprisingly, it turned out that the more time people spent on these sites, the more socially isolated they perceived themselves to be. And perceived social isolation is one of the worst things for us, mentally and physically.\n\nComparing our lives with others is mentally unhealthy\nPart of the reason Facebook makes people feel socially isolated (even though they may not actually be) is the comparison factor. We fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others as we scroll through our feeds, and make judgements about how we measure up. One study looked at how we make comparisons to others posts, in “upward” or “downward” directions—that is, feeling that we’re either better or worse off than our friends. It turned out that both types of comparisons made people feel worse, which is surprising, since in real life, only upward comparisons (feeling another person has it better than you) makes people feel bad. But in the social network world, it seems that any kind of comparison is linked to depressive symptoms.\n\nIt can lead to jealousy—and a vicious cycle\nIt’s no secret that the comparison factor in social media leads to jealousy—most people will admit that seeing other people’s tropical vacations and perfectly behaved kids is envy-inducing. Studies have certainly shown that social media use triggers feelings of jealousy. The authors of one study, looking at jealousy and other negative feelings while using Facebook, wrote that “This magnitude of envy incidents taking place on FB alone is astounding, providing evidence that FB offers a breeding ground for invidious feelings.\n\nThey add that it can become a vicious cycle: feeling jealous can make a person want to make his or her own life look better, and post jealousy-inducing posts of their own, in an endless circle of one-upping and feeling jealous. Another study looked at the connection between envy and depression in Facebook use and, interestingly, discovered that envy mediates the Facebook-depression link. That is, when envy is controlled for, Facebook isn’t so depressing. So it may be the envy that’s largely to blame in the depression-Facebook connection.\n\nWe get caught in the delusion of thinking it will help\nPart of the unhealthy cycle is that we keep coming back to social media, even though it doesn’t make us feel very good. This is probably because of what’s known as a forecasting error: Like a drug, we think getting a fix will help, but it actually makes us feel worse, which comes down to an error in our ability to predict our own response. One study looked at how people feel after using Facebook and how they think they’ll feel going in. Like other studies suggested, the participants in this one almost always felt worse after using it, compared to people engaging in other activities. But a follow-up experiment showed that people generally believed that they’d feel better after using, not worse. Which of course turns out not to be the case at all, and sounds a lot like the pattern in other types of addiction.\n\nMore friends on social doesn’t mean you’re more social\nA couple of years ago, a study found that more friends on social media doesn’t necessarily mean you have a better social life—there seems to be a cap on the number of friends a person’s brain can handle, and it takes actual social interaction (not virtual) to keep up these friendships. So feeling like you’re being social by being on Facebook doesn’t work. Since loneliness is linked to myriad health and mental health problems (including early death), getting real social support is important. Virtual friend time doesn’t have the therapeutic effect as time with real friends.\n\nAll of this is not to say that there’s no benefit to social media—obviously it keeps us connected across great distances, and helps us find people we’d lost touch with years ago. But getting on social when you have some time to kill, or, worse, need an emotional lift, is very likely a bad idea.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>6, "title"=>"6 Ways Social Media Affects Our Mental Health", "content"=>"Health experts love to say that sitting is the new smoking. Given the number of diseases to which sitting is linked, and the number of people it apparently kills every year, sitting is one of the worst things we can do for health. But possibly as concerning is the thing that we often do while we're sitting: Mindlessly scrolling through our social media feeds when we have a few spare minutes (or for some, hours). And as we probably know intuitively, and as the research is confirming, it's not the best habit when it comes to our collective psychology. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned about the potential for negative effects of social media in young kids and teens, including cyber-bullying and \"Facebook depression.\" But the same risks may be true for adults, across generations. Here's a quick run-down of the studies that have shown that social media isn't very good for mental well-being, and in some ways, it can be pretty damaging.\n\nIt’s addictive\nExperts have not been in total agreement on whether internet addiction is a real thing, let alone social media addiction, but there’s some good evidence that both may exist. A review study from Nottingham Trent University looked back over earlier research on the psychological characteristics, personality and social media use. The authors conclude that “it may be plausible to speak specifically of ‘Facebook Addiction Disorder’…because addiction criteria, such as neglect of personal life, mental preoccupation, escapism, mood modifying experiences, tolerance and concealing the addictive behavior, appear to be present in some people who use [social networks] excessively.” (They also found that the motivation for people’s excessive use of social networks differs depending on certain traits—introverts and extroverts use it for different reasons, as do people with narcissistic traits. But that deserves a piece of its own.)\n\nAnd studies have confirmed that people tend to undergo a kind of withdrawal: A study a few years ago from Swansea University found that people experienced the psychological symptoms of withdrawal when they stopped using (this went for all internet use, not just social media). Their recent follow-up study found that when people stop using, they also undergo small but measurable physiological effects. Study author Phil Reed said, “We have known for some time that people who are over-dependent on digital devices report feelings of anxiety when they are stopped from using them, but now we can see that these psychological effects are accompanied by actual physiological changes.” Whether this is true of social media per se is unclear right now, but anecdotal evidence suggests it may be.\n\nIt triggers more sadness, less well-being\nThe more we use social media, the less happy we seem to be. One study a few years ago found that Facebook use was linked to both less moment-to-moment happiness and less life satisfaction—the more people used Facebook in a day, the more these two variables dropped off. The authors suggest this may have to do with the fact that Facebook conjures up a perception of social isolation, in a way that other solitary activities don’t. “On the surface,” the authors write, “Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling such needs by allowing people to instantly connect. Rather than enhancing well-being, as frequent interactions with supportive 'offline' social networks powerfully do, the current findings demonstrate that interacting with Facebook may predict the opposite result for young adults—it may undermine it.”\n\nIn fact, another study found that social media use is linked to greater feelings of social isolation. The team looked at how much people used 11 social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, Snapchat and Reddit, and correlated this with their “perceived social isolation.” Not surprisingly, it turned out that the more time people spent on these sites, the more socially isolated they perceived themselves to be. And perceived social isolation is one of the worst things for us, mentally and physically.\n\nComparing our lives with others is mentally unhealthy\nPart of the reason Facebook makes people feel socially isolated (even though they may not actually be) is the comparison factor. We fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others as we scroll through our feeds, and make judgements about how we measure up. One study looked at how we make comparisons to others posts, in “upward” or “downward” directions—that is, feeling that we’re either better or worse off than our friends. It turned out that both types of comparisons made people feel worse, which is surprising, since in real life, only upward comparisons (feeling another person has it better than you) makes people feel bad. But in the social network world, it seems that any kind of comparison is linked to depressive symptoms.\n\nIt can lead to jealousy—and a vicious cycle\nIt’s no secret that the comparison factor in social media leads to jealousy—most people will admit that seeing other people’s tropical vacations and perfectly behaved kids is envy-inducing. Studies have certainly shown that social media use triggers feelings of jealousy. The authors of one study, looking at jealousy and other negative feelings while using Facebook, wrote that “This magnitude of envy incidents taking place on FB alone is astounding, providing evidence that FB offers a breeding ground for invidious feelings.\n\nThey add that it can become a vicious cycle: feeling jealous can make a person want to make his or her own life look better, and post jealousy-inducing posts of their own, in an endless circle of one-upping and feeling jealous. Another study looked at the connection between envy and depression in Facebook use and, interestingly, discovered that envy mediates the Facebook-depression link. That is, when envy is controlled for, Facebook isn’t so depressing. So it may be the envy that’s largely to blame in the depression-Facebook connection.\n\nWe get caught in the delusion of thinking it will help\nPart of the unhealthy cycle is that we keep coming back to social media, even though it doesn’t make us feel very good. This is probably because of what’s known as a forecasting error: Like a drug, we think getting a fix will help, but it actually makes us feel worse, which comes down to an error in our ability to predict our own response. One study looked at how people feel after using Facebook and how they think they’ll feel going in. Like other studies suggested, the participants in this one almost always felt worse after using it, compared to people engaging in other activities. But a follow-up experiment showed that people generally believed that they’d feel better after using, not worse. Which of course turns out not to be the case at all, and sounds a lot like the pattern in other types of addiction.\n\nMore friends on social doesn’t mean you’re more social\nA couple of years ago, a study found that more friends on social media doesn’t necessarily mean you have a better social life—there seems to be a cap on the number of friends a person’s brain can handle, and it takes actual social interaction (not virtual) to keep up these friendships. So feeling like you’re being social by being on Facebook doesn’t work. Since loneliness is linked to myriad health and mental health problems (including early death), getting real social support is important. Virtual friend time doesn’t have the therapeutic effect as time with real friends.\n\nAll of this is not to say that there’s no benefit to social media—obviously it keeps us connected across great distances, and helps us find people we’d lost touch with years ago. But getting on social when you have some time to kill, or, worse, need an emotional lift, is very likely a bad idea. And studies have found that taking a break from Facebook helps boost psychological well-being. If you are feeling brave, try taking a little break, and see how it goes. And if you are going to keep using, then at least try to use in moderation.", "author"=>"Alice G.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>6, "title"=>"6 Ways Social Media Affects Our Mental Health", "content"=>"Health experts love to say that sitting is the new smoking. Given the number of diseases to which sitting is linked, and the number of people it apparently kills every year, sitting is one of the worst things we can do for health. But possibly as concerning is the thing that we often do while we're sitting: Mindlessly scrolling through our social media feeds when we have a few spare minutes (or for some, hours). And as we probably know intuitively, and as the research is confirming, it's not the best habit when it comes to our collective psychology. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned about the potential for negative effects of social media in young kids and teens, including cyber-bullying and \"Facebook depression.\" But the same risks may be true for adults, across generations. Here's a quick run-down of the studies that have shown that social media isn't very good for mental well-being, and in some ways, it can be pretty damaging.\n\nIt’s addictive\nExperts have not been in total agreement on whether internet addiction is a real thing, let alone social media addiction, but there’s some good evidence that both may exist. A review study from Nottingham Trent University looked back over earlier research on the psychological characteristics, personality and social media use. The authors conclude that “it may be plausible to speak specifically of ‘Facebook Addiction Disorder’…because addiction criteria, such as neglect of personal life, mental preoccupation, escapism, mood modifying experiences, tolerance and concealing the addictive behavior, appear to be present in some people who use [social networks] excessively.” (They also found that the motivation for people’s excessive use of social networks differs depending on certain traits—introverts and extroverts use it for different reasons, as do people with narcissistic traits. But that deserves a piece of its own.)\n\nAnd studies have confirmed that people tend to undergo a kind of withdrawal: A study a few years ago from Swansea University found that people experienced the psychological symptoms of withdrawal when they stopped using (this went for all internet use, not just social media). Their recent follow-up study found that when people stop using, they also undergo small but measurable physiological effects. Study author Phil Reed said, “We have known for some time that people who are over-dependent on digital devices report feelings of anxiety when they are stopped from using them, but now we can see that these psychological effects are accompanied by actual physiological changes.” Whether this is true of social media per se is unclear right now, but anecdotal evidence suggests it may be.\n\nIt triggers more sadness, less well-being\nThe more we use social media, the less happy we seem to be. One study a few years ago found that Facebook use was linked to both less moment-to-moment happiness and less life satisfaction—the more people used Facebook in a day, the more these two variables dropped off. The authors suggest this may have to do with the fact that Facebook conjures up a perception of social isolation, in a way that other solitary activities don’t. “On the surface,” the authors write, “Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling such needs by allowing people to instantly connect. Rather than enhancing well-being, as frequent interactions with supportive 'offline' social networks powerfully do, the current findings demonstrate that interacting with Facebook may predict the opposite result for young adults—it may undermine it.”\n\nIn fact, another study found that social media use is linked to greater feelings of social isolation. The team looked at how much people used 11 social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, Snapchat and Reddit, and correlated this with their “perceived social isolation.” Not surprisingly, it turned out that the more time people spent on these sites, the more socially isolated they perceived themselves to be. And perceived social isolation is one of the worst things for us, mentally and physically.\n\nComparing our lives with others is mentally unhealthy\nPart of the reason Facebook makes people feel socially isolated (even though they may not actually be) is the comparison factor. We fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others as we scroll through our feeds, and make judgements about how we measure up. One study looked at how we make comparisons to others posts, in “upward” or “downward” directions—that is, feeling that we’re either better or worse off than our friends. It turned out that both types of comparisons made people feel worse, which is surprising, since in real life, only upward comparisons (feeling another person has it better than you) makes people feel bad. But in the social network world, it seems that any kind of comparison is linked to depressive symptoms.\n\nIt can lead to jealousy—and a vicious cycle\nIt’s no secret that the comparison factor in social media leads to jealousy—most people will admit that seeing other people’s tropical vacations and perfectly behaved kids is envy-inducing. Studies have certainly shown that social media use triggers feelings of jealousy. The authors of one study, looking at jealousy and other negative feelings while using Facebook, wrote that “This magnitude of envy incidents taking place on FB alone is astounding, providing evidence that FB offers a breeding ground for invidious feelings.\n\nThey add that it can become a vicious cycle: feeling jealous can make a person want to make his or her own life look better, and post jealousy-inducing posts of their own, in an endless circle of one-upping and feeling jealous. Another study looked at the connection between envy and depression in Facebook use and, interestingly, discovered that envy mediates the Facebook-depression link. That is, when envy is controlled for, Facebook isn’t so depressing. So it may be the envy that’s largely to blame in the depression-Facebook connection.\n\nWe get caught in the delusion of thinking it will help\nPart of the unhealthy cycle is that we keep coming back to social media, even though it doesn’t make us feel very good. This is probably because of what’s known as a forecasting error: Like a drug, we think getting a fix will help, but it actually makes us feel worse, which comes down to an error in our ability to predict our own response. One study looked at how people feel after using Facebook and how they think they’ll feel going in. Like other studies suggested, the participants in this one almost always felt worse after using it, compared to people engaging in other activities. But a follow-up experiment showed that people generally believed that they’d feel better after using, not worse. Which of course turns out not to be the case at all, and sounds a lot like the pattern in other types of addiction.\n\nMore friends on social doesn’t mean you’re more social\nA couple of years ago, a study found that more friends on social media doesn’t necessarily mean you have a better social life—there seems to be a cap on the number of friends a person’s brain can handle, and it takes actual social interaction (not virtual) to keep up these friendships. So feeling like you’re being social by being on Facebook doesn’t work. Since loneliness is linked to myriad health and mental health problems (including early death), getting real social support is important. Virtual friend time doesn’t have the therapeutic effect as time with real friends.\n\nAll of this is not to say that there’s no benefit to social media—obviously it keeps us connected across great distances, and helps us find people we’d lost touch with years ago. But getting on social when you have some time to kill, or, worse, need an emotional lift, is very likely a bad idea. And studies have found that taking a break from Facebook helps boost psychological well-being. If you are feeling brave, try taking a little break, and see how it goes. And if you are going to keep using, then at least try to use in moderation.", "author"=>"Alice G.

Rather than enhancing well-being, as frequent interactions with supportive 'offline' social networks powerfully do, the current findings demonstrate that interacting with Facebook may predict the opposite result for young adults—it may undermine it.”\n\nIn fact, another study found that social media use is linked to greater feelings of social isolation. The team looked at how much people used 11 social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, Snapchat and Reddit, and correlated this with their “perceived social isolation.” Not surprisingly, it turned out that the more time people spent on these sites, the more socially isolated they perceived themselves to be. And perceived social isolation is one of the worst things for us, mentally and physically.\n\nComparing our lives with others is mentally unhealthy\nPart of the reason Facebook makes people feel socially isolated (even though they may not actually be) is the comparison factor. We fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others as we scroll through our feeds, and make judgements about how we measure up. One study looked at how we make comparisons to others posts, in “upward” or “downward” directions—that is, feeling that we’re either better or worse off than our friends. It turned out that both types of comparisons made people feel worse, which is surprising, since in real life, only upward comparisons (feeling another person has it better than you) makes people feel bad. But in the social network world, it seems that any kind of comparison is linked to depressive symptoms.\n\nIt can lead to jealousy—and a vicious cycle\nIt’s no secret that the comparison factor in social media leads to jealousy—most people will admit that seeing other people’s tropical vacations and perfectly behaved kids is envy-inducing. Studies have certainly shown that social media use triggers feelings of jealousy. The authors of one study, looking at jealousy and other negative feelings while using Facebook, wrote that “This magnitude of envy incidents taking place on FB alone is astounding, providing evidence that FB offers a breeding ground for invidious feelings.\n\nThey add that it can become a vicious cycle: feeling jealous can make a person want to make his or her own life look better, and post jealousy-inducing posts of their own, in an endless circle of one-upping and feeling jealous. Another study looked at the connection between envy and depression in Facebook use and, interestingly, discovered that envy mediates the Facebook-depression link. That is, when envy is controlled for, Facebook isn’t so depressing. So it may be the envy that’s largely to blame in the depression-Facebook connection.\n\nWe get caught in the delusion of thinking it will help\nPart of the unhealthy cycle is that we keep coming back to social media, even though it doesn’t make us feel very good. This is probably because of what’s known as a forecasting error: Like a drug, we think getting a fix will help, but it actually makes us feel worse, which comes down to an error in our ability to predict our own response. One study looked at how people feel after using Facebook and how they think they’ll feel going in. Like other studies suggested, the participants in this one almost always felt worse after using it, compared to people engaging in other activities. But a follow-up experiment showed that people generally believed that they’d feel better after using, not worse. Which of course turns out not to be the case at all, and sounds a lot like the pattern in other types of addiction.\n\nMore friends on social doesn’t mean you’re more social\nA couple of years ago, a study found that more friends on social media doesn’t necessarily mean you have a better social life—there seems to be a cap on the number of friends a person’s brain can handle, and it takes actual social interaction (not virtual) to keep up these friendships. So feeling like you’re being social by being on Facebook doesn’t work. Since loneliness is linked to myriad health and mental health problems (including early death), getting real social support is important. Virtual friend time doesn’t have the therapeutic effect as time with real friends.\n\nAll of this is not to say that there’s no benefit to social media—obviously it keeps us connected across great distances, and helps us find people we’d lost touch with years ago. But getting on social when you have some time to kill, or, worse, need an emotional lift, is very likely a bad idea. And studies have found that taking a break from Facebook helps boost psychological well-being. If you are feeling brave, try taking a little break, and see how it goes. And if you are going to keep using, then at least try to use in moderation.", "author"=>"Alice G.

For example, an initial diagnosis of depression was just as likely to be followed by a second diagnosis of anxiety, and vice versa.\n\tImportantly, people who were younger than 20 at the onset of their first mental disorder were significantly more at risk of developing a second disorderover the next 10-15 years, and this vulnerability was found across most pairs of disorders.\n\t\"We found that in younger people, mental health disorders were more \"pluripotent\", meaning an observed change or disruption in mental health was more flexible in the direction it manifested as a disorder,\" Professor McGrath said.\n\tNot only is the study the largest and most comprehensive in its field, but its innovative presentation of results has set a new standard for epidemiology (the study of health and disease data), said Professor McGrath.\n\t\"The paper is open access, with all data available and code free to download, and results presented in an interactive website with educational videos,\" he said.\n\t\"It is far more user-friendly than the traditional method of presenting results purely in an academic paper.\"\n\t\"We have provided a detailed, comprehensive atlas of the ways that mental disorders cluster together available openly for public use, and we hope that this informs better practice, better clinical care, and future research.\"\n\tThe next step for Professor McGrath and his colleagues is to extend the study to identify the risks between mental disorders and the subsequent onset of general medical conditions, such as epilepsy, migraine, heart attacks, and diabetes.\n\tThe paper was published in JAMA Psychiatry and supported by the Danish National Research Foundation.", "author"=>"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190117090515.htm", "created_at"=>"2019-02-05T00:17:49.607Z", "image"=>"https://images.pexels.com/photos/326055/pexels-photo-326055.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500", "likes"=>7}, "id"=>"1"}

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>2, "title"=>"10 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>6, "title"=>"6 Ways Social Media Affects Our Mental Health", "content"=>"Health experts love to say that sitting is the new smoking. Given the number of diseases to which sitting is linked, and the number of people it apparently kills every year, sitting is one of the worst things we can do for health. But possibly as concerning is the thing that we often do while we're sitting: Mindlessly scrolling through our social media feeds when we have a few spare minutes (or for some, hours). And as we probably know intuitively, and as the research is confirming, it's not the best habit when it comes to our collective psychology. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned about the potential for negative effects of social media in young kids and teens, including cyber-bullying and \"Facebook depression.\" But the same risks may be true for adults, across generations. Here's a quick run-down of the studies that have shown that social media isn't very good for mental well-being, and in some ways, it can be pretty damaging.\n\nIt’s addictive\nExperts have not been in total agreement on whether internet addiction is a real thing, let alone social media addiction, but there’s some good evidence that both may exist. A review study from Nottingham Trent University looked back over earlier research on the psychological characteristics, personality and social media use. The authors conclude that “it may be plausible to speak specifically of ‘Facebook Addiction Disorder’…because addiction criteria, such as neglect of personal life, mental preoccupation, escapism, mood modifying experiences, tolerance and concealing the addictive behavior, appear to be present in some people who use [social networks] excessively.” (They also found that the motivation for people’s excessive use of social networks differs depending on certain traits—introverts and extroverts use it for different reasons, as do people with narcissistic traits. But that deserves a piece of its own.)\n\nAnd studies have confirmed that people tend to undergo a kind of withdrawal: A study a few years ago from Swansea University found that people experienced the psychological symptoms of withdrawal when they stopped using (this went for all internet use, not just social media). Their recent follow-up study found that when people stop using, they also undergo small but measurable physiological effects. Study author Phil Reed said, “We have known for some time that people who are over-dependent on digital devices report feelings of anxiety when they are stopped from using them, but now we can see that these psychological effects are accompanied by actual physiological changes.” Whether this is true of social media per se is unclear right now, but anecdotal evidence suggests it may be.\n\nIt triggers more sadness, less well-being\nThe more we use social media, the less happy we seem to be. One study a few years ago found that Facebook use was linked to both less moment-to-moment happiness and less life satisfaction—the more people used Facebook in a day, the more these two variables dropped off. The authors suggest this may have to do with the fact that Facebook conjures up a perception of social isolation, in a way that other solitary activities don’t. “On the surface,” the authors write, “Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling such needs by allowing people to instantly connect. Rather than enhancing well-being, as frequent interactions with supportive 'offline' social networks powerfully do, the current findings demonstrate that interacting with Facebook may predict the opposite result for young adults—it may undermine it.”\n\nIn fact, another study found that social media use is linked to greater feelings of social isolation. The team looked at how much people used 11 social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, Snapchat and Reddit, and correlated this with their “perceived social isolation.” Not surprisingly, it turned out that the more time people spent on these sites, the more socially isolated they perceived themselves to be. And perceived social isolation is one of the worst things for us, mentally and physically.\n\nComparing our lives with others is mentally unhealthy\nPart of the reason Facebook makes people feel socially isolated (even though they may not actually be) is the comparison factor. We fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others as we scroll through our feeds, and make judgements about how we measure up. One study looked at how we make comparisons to others posts, in “upward” or “downward” directions—that is, feeling that we’re either better or worse off than our friends. It turned out that both types of comparisons made people feel worse, which is surprising, since in real life, only upward comparisons (feeling another person has it better than you) makes people feel bad. But in the social network world, it seems that any kind of comparison is linked to depressive symptoms.\n\nIt can lead to jealousy—and a vicious cycle\nIt’s no secret that the comparison factor in social media leads to jealousy—most people will admit that seeing other people’s tropical vacations and perfectly behaved kids is envy-inducing. Studies have certainly shown that social media use triggers feelings of jealousy. The authors of one study, looking at jealousy and other negative feelings while using Facebook, wrote that “This magnitude of envy incidents taking place on FB alone is astounding, providing evidence that FB offers a breeding ground for invidious feelings.\n\nThey add that it can become a vicious cycle: feeling jealous can make a person want to make his or her own life look better, and post jealousy-inducing posts of their own, in an endless circle of one-upping and feeling jealous. Another study looked at the connection between envy and depression in Facebook use and, interestingly, discovered that envy mediates the Facebook-depression link. That is, when envy is controlled for, Facebook isn’t so depressing. So it may be the envy that’s largely to blame in the depression-Facebook connection.\n\nWe get caught in the delusion of thinking it will help\nPart of the unhealthy cycle is that we keep coming back to social media, even though it doesn’t make us feel very good. This is probably because of what’s known as a forecasting error: Like a drug, we think getting a fix will help, but it actually makes us feel worse, which comes down to an error in our ability to predict our own response. One study looked at how people feel after using Facebook and how they think they’ll feel going in. Like other studies suggested, the participants in this one almost always felt worse after using it, compared to people engaging in other activities. But a follow-up experiment showed that people generally believed that they’d feel better after using, not worse. Which of course turns out not to be the case at all, and sounds a lot like the pattern in other types of addiction.\n\nMore friends on social doesn’t mean you’re more social\nA couple of years ago, a study found that more friends on social media doesn’t necessarily mean you have a better social life—there seems to be a cap on the number of friends a person’s brain can handle, and it takes actual social interaction (not virtual) to keep up these friendships. So feeling like you’re being social by being on Facebook doesn’t work. Since loneliness is linked to myriad health and mental health problems (including early death), getting real social support is important. Virtual friend time doesn’t have the therapeutic effect as time with real friends.\n\nAll of this is not to say that there’s no benefit to social media—obviously it keeps us connected across great distances, and helps us find people we’d lost touch with years ago. But getting on social when you have some time to kill, or, worse, need an emotional lift, is very likely a bad idea. And studies have found that taking a break from Facebook helps boost psychological well-being. If you are feeling brave, try taking a little break, and see how it goes. And if you are going to keep using, then at least try to use in moderation.", "author"=>"Alice G.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>6, "title"=>"6 Ways Social Media Affects Our Mental Health", "content"=>"Health experts love to say that sitting is the new smoking. Given the number of diseases to which sitting is linked, and the number of people it apparently kills every year, sitting is one of the worst things we can do for health. But possibly as concerning is the thing that we often do while we're sitting: Mindlessly scrolling through our social media feeds when we have a few spare minutes (or for some, hours). And as we probably know intuitively, and as the research is confirming, it's not the best habit when it comes to our collective psychology. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned about the potential for negative effects of social media in young kids and teens, including cyber-bullying and \"Facebook depression.\" But the same risks may be true for adults, across generations. Here's a quick run-down of the studies that have shown that social media isn't very good for mental well-being, and in some ways, it can be pretty damaging.\n\nIt’s addictive\nExperts have not been in total agreement on whether internet addiction is a real thing, let alone social media addiction, but there’s some good evidence that both may exist. A review study from Nottingham Trent University looked back over earlier research on the psychological characteristics, personality and social media use. The authors conclude that “it may be plausible to speak specifically of ‘Facebook Addiction Disorder’…because addiction criteria, such as neglect of personal life, mental preoccupation, escapism, mood modifying experiences, tolerance and concealing the addictive behavior, appear to be present in some people who use [social networks] excessively.” (They also found that the motivation for people’s excessive use of social networks differs depending on certain traits—introverts and extroverts use it for different reasons, as do people with narcissistic traits. But that deserves a piece of its own.)\n\nAnd studies have confirmed that people tend to undergo a kind of withdrawal: A study a few years ago from Swansea University found that people experienced the psychological symptoms of withdrawal when they stopped using (this went for all internet use, not just social media). Their recent follow-up study found that when people stop using, they also undergo small but measurable physiological effects. Study author Phil Reed said, “We have known for some time that people who are over-dependent on digital devices report feelings of anxiety when they are stopped from using them, but now we can see that these psychological effects are accompanied by actual physiological changes.” Whether this is true of social media per se is unclear right now, but anecdotal evidence suggests it may be.\n\nIt triggers more sadness, less well-being\nThe more we use social media, the less happy we seem to be. One study a few years ago found that Facebook use was linked to both less moment-to-moment happiness and less life satisfaction—the more people used Facebook in a day, the more these two variables dropped off. The authors suggest this may have to do with the fact that Facebook conjures up a perception of social isolation, in a way that other solitary activities don’t. “On the surface,” the authors write, “Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling such needs by allowing people to instantly connect. Rather than enhancing well-being, as frequent interactions with supportive 'offline' social networks powerfully do, the current findings demonstrate that interacting with Facebook may predict the opposite result for young adults—it may undermine it.”\n\nIn fact, another study found that social media use is linked to greater feelings of social isolation. The team looked at how much people used 11 social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, Snapchat and Reddit, and correlated this with their “perceived social isolation.” Not surprisingly, it turned out that the more time people spent on these sites, the more socially isolated they perceived themselves to be. And perceived social isolation is one of the worst things for us, mentally and physically.\n\nComparing our lives with others is mentally unhealthy\nPart of the reason Facebook makes people feel socially isolated (even though they may not actually be) is the comparison factor. We fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others as we scroll through our feeds, and make judgements about how we measure up. One study looked at how we make comparisons to others posts, in “upward” or “downward” directions—that is, feeling that we’re either better or worse off than our friends. It turned out that both types of comparisons made people feel worse, which is surprising, since in real life, only upward comparisons (feeling another person has it better than you) makes people feel bad. But in the social network world, it seems that any kind of comparison is linked to depressive symptoms.\n\nIt can lead to jealousy—and a vicious cycle\nIt’s no secret that the comparison factor in social media leads to jealousy—most people will admit that seeing other people’s tropical vacations and perfectly behaved kids is envy-inducing. Studies have certainly shown that social media use triggers feelings of jealousy. The authors of one study, looking at jealousy and other negative feelings while using Facebook, wrote that “This magnitude of envy incidents taking place on FB alone is astounding, providing evidence that FB offers a breeding ground for invidious feelings.\n\nThey add that it can become a vicious cycle: feeling jealous can make a person want to make his or her own life look better, and post jealousy-inducing posts of their own, in an endless circle of one-upping and feeling jealous. Another study looked at the connection between envy and depression in Facebook use and, interestingly, discovered that envy mediates the Facebook-depression link. That is, when envy is controlled for, Facebook isn’t so depressing. So it may be the envy that’s largely to blame in the depression-Facebook connection.\n\nWe get caught in the delusion of thinking it will help\nPart of the unhealthy cycle is that we keep coming back to social media, even though it doesn’t make us feel very good. This is probably because of what’s known as a forecasting error: Like a drug, we think getting a fix will help, but it actually makes us feel worse, which comes down to an error in our ability to predict our own response. One study looked at how people feel after using Facebook and how they think they’ll feel going in. Like other studies suggested, the participants in this one almost always felt worse after using it, compared to people engaging in other activities. But a follow-up experiment showed that people generally believed that they’d feel better after using, not worse. Which of course turns out not to be the case at all, and sounds a lot like the pattern in other types of addiction.\n\nMore friends on social doesn’t mean you’re more social\nA couple of years ago, a study found that more friends on social media doesn’t necessarily mean you have a better social life—there seems to be a cap on the number of friends a person’s brain can handle, and it takes actual social interaction (not virtual) to keep up these friendships. So feeling like you’re being social by being on Facebook doesn’t work. Since loneliness is linked to myriad health and mental health problems (including early death), getting real social support is important. Virtual friend time doesn’t have the therapeutic effect as time with real friends.\n\nAll of this is not to say that there’s no benefit to social media—obviously it keeps us connected across great distances, and helps us find people we’d lost touch with years ago. But getting on social when you have some time to kill, or, worse, need an emotional lift, is very likely a bad idea. And studies have found that taking a break from Facebook helps boost psychological well-being. If you are feeling brave, try taking a little break, and see how it goes. And if you are going to keep using, then at least try to use in moderation.", "author"=>"Alice G.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>6, "title"=>"6 Ways Social Media Affects Our Mental Health", "content"=>"Health experts love to say that sitting is the new smoking. Given the number of diseases to which sitting is linked, and the number of people it apparently kills every year, sitting is one of the worst things we can do for health. But possibly as concerning is the thing that we often do while we're sitting: Mindlessly scrolling through our social media feeds when we have a few spare minutes (or for some, hours). And as we probably know intuitively, and as the research is confirming, it's not the best habit when it comes to our collective psychology. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned about the potential for negative effects of social media in young kids and teens, including cyber-bullying and \"Facebook depression.\" But the same risks may be true for adults, across generations. Here's a quick run-down of the studies that have shown that social media isn't very good for mental well-being, and in some ways, it can be pretty damaging.\n\nIt’s addictive\nExperts have not been in total agreement on whether internet addiction is a real thing, let alone social media addiction, but there’s some good evidence that both may exist. A review study from Nottingham Trent University looked back over earlier research on the psychological characteristics, personality and social media use. The authors conclude that “it may be plausible to speak specifically of ‘Facebook Addiction Disorder’…because addiction criteria, such as neglect of personal life, mental preoccupation, escapism, mood modifying experiences, tolerance and concealing the addictive behavior, appear to be present in some people who use [social networks] excessively.” (They also found that the motivation for people’s excessive use of social networks differs depending on certain traits—introverts and extroverts use it for different reasons, as do people with narcissistic traits. But that deserves a piece of its own.)\n\nAnd studies have confirmed that people tend to undergo a kind of withdrawal: A study a few years ago from Swansea University found that people experienced the psychological symptoms of withdrawal when they stopped using (this went for all internet use, not just social media). Their recent follow-up study found that when people stop using, they also undergo small but measurable physiological effects. Study author Phil Reed said, “We have known for some time that people who are over-dependent on digital devices report feelings of anxiety when they are stopped from using them, but now we can see that these psychological effects are accompanied by actual physiological changes.” Whether this is true of social media per se is unclear right now, but anecdotal evidence suggests it may be.\n\nIt triggers more sadness, less well-being\nThe more we use social media, the less happy we seem to be. One study a few years ago found that Facebook use was linked to both less moment-to-moment happiness and less life satisfaction—the more people used Facebook in a day, the more these two variables dropped off. The authors suggest this may have to do with the fact that Facebook conjures up a perception of social isolation, in a way that other solitary activities don’t. “On the surface,” the authors write, “Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling such needs by allowing people to instantly connect. Rather than enhancing well-being, as frequent interactions with supportive 'offline' social networks powerfully do, the current findings demonstrate that interacting with Facebook may predict the opposite result for young adults—it may undermine it.”\n\nIn fact, another study found that social media use is linked to greater feelings of social isolation. The team looked at how much people used 11 social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, Snapchat and Reddit, and correlated this with their “perceived social isolation.” Not surprisingly, it turned out that the more time people spent on these sites, the more socially isolated they perceived themselves to be. And perceived social isolation is one of the worst things for us, mentally and physically.\n\nComparing our lives with others is mentally unhealthy\nPart of the reason Facebook makes people feel socially isolated (even though they may not actually be) is the comparison factor. We fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others as we scroll through our feeds, and make judgements about how we measure up. One study looked at how we make comparisons to others posts, in “upward” or “downward” directions—that is, feeling that we’re either better or worse off than our friends. It turned out that both types of comparisons made people feel worse, which is surprising, since in real life, only upward comparisons (feeling another person has it better than you) makes people feel bad. But in the social network world, it seems that any kind of comparison is linked to depressive symptoms.\n\nIt can lead to jealousy—and a vicious cycle\nIt’s no secret that the comparison factor in social media leads to jealousy—most people will admit that seeing other people’s tropical vacations and perfectly behaved kids is envy-inducing. Studies have certainly shown that social media use triggers feelings of jealousy. The authors of one study, looking at jealousy and other negative feelings while using Facebook, wrote that “This magnitude of envy incidents taking place on FB alone is astounding, providing evidence that FB offers a breeding ground for invidious feelings.\n\nThey add that it can become a vicious cycle: feeling jealous can make a person want to make his or her own life look better, and post jealousy-inducing posts of their own, in an endless circle of one-upping and feeling jealous. Another study looked at the connection between envy and depression in Facebook use and, interestingly, discovered that envy mediates the Facebook-depression link. That is, when envy is controlled for, Facebook isn’t so depressing. So it may be the envy that’s largely to blame in the depression-Facebook connection.\n\nWe get caught in the delusion of thinking it will help\nPart of the unhealthy cycle is that we keep coming back to social media, even though it doesn’t make us feel very good. This is probably because of what’s known as a forecasting error: Like a drug, we think getting a fix will help, but it actually makes us feel worse, which comes down to an error in our ability to predict our own response. One study looked at how people feel after using Facebook and how they think they’ll feel going in. Like other studies suggested, the participants in this one almost always felt worse after using it, compared to people engaging in other activities. But a follow-up experiment showed that people generally believed that they’d feel better after using, not worse. Which of course turns out not to be the case at all, and sounds a lot like the pattern in other types of addiction.\n\nMore friends on social doesn’t mean you’re more social\nA couple of years ago, a study found that more friends on social media doesn’t necessarily mean you have a better social life—there seems to be a cap on the number of friends a person’s brain can handle, and it takes actual social interaction (not virtual) to keep up these friendships. So feeling like you’re being social by being on Facebook doesn’t work. Since loneliness is linked to myriad health and mental health problems (including early death), getting real social support is important. Virtual friend time doesn’t have the therapeutic effect as time with real friends.\n\nAll of this is not to say that there’s no benefit to social media—obviously it keeps us connected across great distances, and helps us find people we’d lost touch with years ago. But getting on social when you have some time to kill, or, worse, need an emotional lift, is very likely a bad idea. And studies have found that taking a break from Facebook helps boost psychological well-being. If you are feeling brave, try taking a little break, and see how it goes. And if you are going to keep using, then at least try to use in moderation.", "author"=>"Alice G.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>3, "title"=>"What Is Depression?", "content"=>"Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\n\n\tDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n\tFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\tChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\tLoss of energy or increased fatigue\n\tIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\n\tFeeling worthless or guilty\n\tDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\tThoughts of death or suicide\n\tSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\n\n\tAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\n\n\tDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.\n\n\tDepression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\n\tThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\n\n\tBut being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:\n\n\tIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.\n\tIn grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.\n\tFor some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.\n\tRisk Factors for Depression\n\tDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\n\tSeveral factors can play a role in depression:\n\n\tBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.\n\tGenetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.\n\tPersonality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.\n\tEnvironmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.\n\tHow Is Depression Treated?\n\tDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\n\n\tBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"Risk for developing more than one mental health disorder revealed", "content"=>"The risk of developing a second mental health disorder after an initial diagnosis is increased, according to new research led by Professor John McGrath from UQs Queensland Brain Institute and Aarhus University.\n\tProfessor McGrath and colleagues looked at Danish health data across a record 5.9 million individuals, providing the largest and most comprehensive study of comorbidity -- the development of two or more mental health disorders.\n\tThis long time frame enabled researchers to track a persons mental health for extended periods of time, and resulted in the startling finding that risk of a second mental health diagnosis remains high, even fifteen years after an initial diagnosis.\n\t\"In the first six months after initial diagnosis, the risk of a second mental health diagnosis is very high: so for example, people diagnosed with mood disorders like depression have a very high risk of being diagnosed with a neurotic disorder like anxiety in the first six months since diagnosis,\" Professor McGrath said.\n\t\"After the first year this risk drops substantially, but it then stabilises and remains 2 or 3 times higher than those without a prior disorder, even fifteen years after initial diagnosis.\"\n\t\"Importantly, the result was pervasive -- we found it across all pairs of disorders that we studied.\"\n\tThe findings also suggest that for some pairs of disorders, it did not matter which one came first -- there was an increased risk of developing the other disorders. For example, an initial diagnosis of depression was just as likely to be followed by a second diagnosis of anxiety, and vice versa.\n\tImportantly, people who were younger than 20 at the onset of their first mental disorder were significantly more at risk of developing a second disorderover the next 10-15 years, and this vulnerability was found across most pairs of disorders.\n\t\"We found that in younger people, mental health disorders were more \"pluripotent\", meaning an observed change or disruption in mental health was more flexible in the direction it manifested as a disorder,\" Professor McGrath said.\n\tNot only is the study the largest and most comprehensive in its field, but its innovative presentation of results has set a new standard for epidemiology (the study of health and disease data), said Professor McGrath.\n\t\"The paper is open access, with all data available and code free to download, and results presented in an interactive website with educational videos,\" he said.\n\t\"It is far more user-friendly than the traditional method of presenting results purely in an academic paper.\"\n\t\"We have provided a detailed, comprehensive atlas of the ways that mental disorders cluster together available openly for public use, and we hope that this informs better practice, better clinical care, and future research.\"\n\tThe next step for Professor McGrath and his colleagues is to extend the study to identify the risks between mental disorders and the subsequent onset of general medical conditions, such as epilepsy, migraine, heart attacks, and diabetes.\n\tThe paper was published in JAMA Psychiatry and supported by the Danish National Research Foundation.", "author"=>"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190117090515.htm", "created_at"=>"2019-02-05T00:17:49.607Z", "image"=>"https://images.pexels.com/photos/326055/pexels-photo-326055.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500", "likes"=>28}, "id"=>"1"}

For example, an initial diagnosis of depression was just as likely to be followed by a second diagnosis of anxiety, and vice versa.\n\tImportantly, people who were younger than 20 at the onset of their first mental disorder were significantly more at risk of developing a second disorderover the next 10-15 years, and this vulnerability was found across most pairs of disorders.\n\t\"We found that in younger people, mental health disorders were more \"pluripotent\", meaning an observed change or disruption in mental health was more flexible in the direction it manifested as a disorder,\" Professor McGrath said.\n\tNot only is the study the largest and most comprehensive in its field, but its innovative presentation of results has set a new standard for epidemiology (the study of health and disease data), said Professor McGrath.\n\t\"The paper is open access, with all data available and code free to download, and results presented in an interactive website with educational videos,\" he said.\n\t\"It is far more user-friendly than the traditional method of presenting results purely in an academic paper.\"\n\t\"We have provided a detailed, comprehensive atlas of the ways that mental disorders cluster together available openly for public use, and we hope that this informs better practice, better clinical care, and future research.\"\n\tThe next step for Professor McGrath and his colleagues is to extend the study to identify the risks between mental disorders and the subsequent onset of general medical conditions, such as epilepsy, migraine, heart attacks, and diabetes.\n\tThe paper was published in JAMA Psychiatry and supported by the Danish National Research Foundation.", "author"=>"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190117090515.htm", "created_at"=>"2019-02-05T00:17:49.607Z", "image"=>"https://images.pexels.com/photos/326055/pexels-photo-326055.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500", "likes"=>48, "article"=>{"id"=>"1", "title"=>"Risk for developing more than one mental health disorder revealed", "content"=>"The risk of developing a second mental health disorder after an initial diagnosis is increased, according to new research led by Professor John McGrath from UQs Queensland Brain Institute and Aarhus University.\n\tProfessor McGrath and colleagues looked at Danish health data across a record 5.9 million individuals, providing the largest and most comprehensive study of comorbidity -- the development of two or more mental health disorders.\n\tThis long time frame enabled researchers to track a persons mental health for extended periods of time, and resulted in the startling finding that risk of a second mental health diagnosis remains high, even fifteen years after an initial diagnosis.\n\t\"In the first six months after initial diagnosis, the risk of a second mental health diagnosis is very high: so for example, people diagnosed with mood disorders like depression have a very high risk of being diagnosed with a neurotic disorder like anxiety in the first six months since diagnosis,\" Professor McGrath said.\n\t\"After the first year this risk drops substantially, but it then stabilises and remains 2 or 3 times higher than those without a prior disorder, even fifteen years after initial diagnosis.\"\n\t\"Importantly, the result was pervasive -- we found it across all pairs of disorders that we studied.\"\n\tThe findings also suggest that for some pairs of disorders, it did not matter which one came first -- there was an increased risk of developing the other disorders.

You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves."], ["created_at", "2019-02-06 04:54:20.658392"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-06 04:54:20.658392"], ["author", "R.

Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\n\n\tDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n\tFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\tChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\tLoss of energy or increased fatigue\n\tIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\n\tFeeling worthless or guilty\n\tDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\tThoughts of death or suicide\n\tSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\n\n\tAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\n\n\tDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.\n\n\tDepression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\n\tThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\n\n\tBut being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:\n\n\tIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.\n\tIn grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.\n\tFor some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.\n\tRisk Factors for Depression\n\tDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\n\tSeveral factors can play a role in depression:\n\n\tBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.\n\tGenetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.\n\tPersonality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.\n\tEnvironmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.\n\tHow Is Depression Treated?\n\tDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\n\n\tBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

It’s not easy to be happy most of the time, but there are some tips that we can apply to make us happier.\n\nHere are ten scientific ways you can change your life to make your days just a bit more joyful:\n\n1. Do More Physical Exercise\nIt is one of the most common New Year’s Resolutions, and science has proven why exercise is very important in our life. A study cited in the book: “The Happiness Advantage” also confirmed the importance of exercise on our happiness level.\n\nBasically, this study looks into three groups of depressed patients. These three groups of depressed patients are each treated with medication, exercise, or a combination of the two. Here’s what they found:\n\n“The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate. Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent!”\n\nThis study shows that exercise has the biggest effect in reducing depression.\n\nHere’s another study in the Journal of Health Psychology that also found that people who exercised are happier because they feel better about their bodies.\n\nAll the evidence has shown that the benefits of exercise include a happy life, so what are you waiting for? Start exercising now. Start small and build a habit of routine exercising, so that you will be happier.\n\n2. Get More Quality Sleep\nWe spend roughly one third of our lives sleeping, so you cannot underestimate the importance of sleep for the quality of our lifes. Here’s an interesting study in 2011 from BPS Research Digest that shows how sleep affects our happiness. The research found that people who take an afternoon nap are desensitized to negative emotions yet more responsive to positive ones.\n\nThis research shows that not only does sleep deprivation cause emotional problems, a sleep boost can bring emotional advantage. In other words, a good quality sleep does make people more positive and overally happier.\n\n3. Put down your cellphone\nA study by Kent State University surveyed more than 500 students and found that frequent cellphone use was associated with lower grades, higher anxiety, and reduced happiness.\n\n“It’s likely that people spending more time on devices have less frequent contact with live social networks, and may be more vulnerable to social comparison that leaves them with a sense of emptiness,” says Ramani Durvasula, PhD, licensed clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at California State University in Los Angeles. “And anxiety may be due to the ‘I don’t want to miss out on anything’ effect – seeing everyone else’s social calendar makes it difficult to stay present in their own lives.”\n\nEven Aristotle extolled moderation in all things. Cell phone and technology is no exception. Excessive use of even the best technologies reduces our happiness in meaningful ways. So, put down your cellphone and your happiness level will surely improve.\n\n4. Take More Social Time\nPerhaps you have heard about it before, but one of the top five regrets of the dying people is not spending enough time or staying in touch with friends and family. Spending more time with the people we care about is very beneficial to improving our happiness and our overall quality of life.\n\nDan Gilbert, a Professor of Psychology in Harvard University explains it very well:\n\n“We are happy when we have family, we are happy when we have friends and almost all the other things we think make us happy are actually just ways of getting more family and friends.”\n\nInterestingly, not only that your social relationship can make you happier, it will also make you live a richer life. A study published in the Journal of Socio-Economics used a shadow pricing method and estimates that your relationships are worth around an additional $131,232 a year.\n\nSo, just call your cousin who lives in another city and catch up with them on the phone. That will actually make you happier.\n\n5. Spend More Time Outdoors\nShawn Achor, who has lectured at Harvard University and Wharton School of Business, wrote in his book: ”The Happiness Advantage”, that spending as little as 20 minutes outside in a good weather not only boosts positive mood, but also broadens thinking and improves the working memory.\n\nAnother study from The London School of Economics and Political Science also supports this claim. It mentioned that being outdoors, near the sea, on a warm, sunny weekend afternoon is the perfect spot for most. In fact, the participants of the study were found to be substantially happier outdoors in all natural environments than they were in urban environments.\n\nIf you wonder what’s the best temperature that maximizes our happiness, you will be amazed that a research by the American Meteorological Society found that happiness is maximized at 13.9°C.\n\n6. Help others for two hours per week\nYou might be surprised to hear this, but spending money on other people (also called “prosocial spending”) boost happiness more than buying things for ourselves.\n\nA 2012 Harvard study gave away some money to participants of the study. Half of them were asked to spend it on buying things for themselves, while the other half was asked to spend the money by buying things for others. Here’s what they found:\n\n“Participants assigned to recall a purchase made for someone else reported feeling significantly happier immediately after this recollection; most importantly, the happier participants felt, the more likely they were to choose to spend a windfall on someone else in the near future. Thus, by providing initial evidence for a positive feedback loop between prosocial spending and well-being, these data offer one potential path to sustainable happiness: prosocial spending increases happiness which in turn encourages prosocial spending.”\n\nNo wonder most millionaires and billionaires are very active in philanthropy. Philanthropy has been proven to increase happiness.\n\nHelping others does not always mean you need to spend money; you can also spend your time (for example via volunteering). Here’s a study in Zurich, Switzerland that supports the notion that volunteering is rewarding in terms of higher life satisfaction.\n\nSo, how much time should you spend helping others? Buffer Blog has concluded that 100 hours per year (or two hours per week) is the optimal time we should dedicate to helping others, in order to enrich our lives and be happier\n\n7. Meditate\nYou might have heard that meditation is very important. The truth is, yes, meditation helps you improve focus, clarity, attention span,  calmness, and, you guessed it right, your happiness.\n\nA research team from Massachusetts General Hospital looked at the brain scans of 16 people before and after they participated in an eight-week course in mindfulness meditation. This study concluded that after completing the course, parts of the participants’ brains associated with compassion and self-awareness grew, and parts associated with stress shrank.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Start meditating now and you will live a happier life.\n\n8. Practice Gratitude\nGratitude is the act of being thankful for simple things in our life. Practicing gratitude has been proven to increase happiness. There’s a study from Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that suggests that a conscious focus on blessings (in other words: practicing gratitude) have emotional and interpersonal benefits. So, be grateful of the every little thing in your life, because there are a lot more people that are not as fortunate as you.\n\n9. Spend money on experience, not things\nEveryone knows that money can’t buy happiness per se, but if you’re going to spend money in search of satisfaction, splurge on an experience, not an expensive toy. A study in Psychological Science found that those who tended to spend their money on doing, as opposed to having, were better off in the long run. This effect was chalked up to the perceived superiority of anticipating an experience (like a trip) to anticipating owning an object (like shoes).\n\n10. Practice Your Spirituality Or Faith\nThough religion alone isn’t a great predictor of happiness, a study published in Frontiers In Psychology found that those who actively practiced their faith were happier than both those who had a religion but didn’t practice, and those who were non-religious. This isn’t to say that you have to be religious to be happy, but if you DO have theological inclinations, you may want to make spirituality a habit."], ["created_at", "2019-02-06 04:54:20.666918"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-06 04:54:20.666918"], ["author", "Teddy Lim"], ["image", "https://images.pexels.com/photos/248771/pexels-photo-248771.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500"]]

But I promise I will try to understand, and try to help you through this. I see you, and I see you’re hurting.\n\nI see you’re lonely, but you are not alone. I am here, and will not leave until you ask me to. What can I do to help? I can offer a listening ear, a hand to hold and a shoulder to cry on. I can show you funny YouTube videos to make you laugh, or encourage you with my favorite uplifting quotes from Pinterest. If you don’t want any of that, if you don’t want to talk, that’s OK. I can make you a cup of tea, turn on Netflix and sit here quietly. But I’m still here.\n\nI see you doubting yourself, but please don’t. You are my sister and part of my heart. You matter, and how you feel is important. You are not unlovable, you are not unwanted. I know you feel like that right now, but that’s the depression talking. You are loved, you are wanted and your life is valuable. You are important to me, and what you’re feeling is valid.\n\nPlease don’t doubt yourself; you are loving, you are kind and you are beautiful, whether you are depressed or not.\n\nI see that it’s hard for you to get out of bed today, and that’s OK. But when you do get out of bed, celebrate. It’s the small victories that will help you get through this. Taking a shower and doing the dishes seem daunting, I know. Take your daily tasks one step at a time. Do you need help? Let me do the dishes. Tell me what else you need me to do today. If you need me to, I will encourage you to stay out of bed. If you want to stay in bed today, that’s OK, but try and get out of bed tomorrow.\nI see you blaming yourself for how you’re feeling, but it’s not your fault. You’re not choosing to be depressed, depression has chosen you. Being depressed is kind of like having the flu. When you’re sick, you forget how good you felt before. When you’re depressed, you forget what it’s like to be happy. But just like the flu, you will feel better. If you take your medicine, take care of your body and let others help you, you will feel better.\n\nI see you calling your depression a weakness. Depression is not who you are. You are strong, probably stronger than you think, and you are a fighter. All fighters need someone in their corner, and I will be that for you. I will be here to remind you that you are not weak, and help give you the strength you need to fight through this.\n\nDuring the times you feel small and unable to be seen, I want you to know I see you, and I see your pain. I care about you, and will be with you through this. When others don’t want to listen, I will. When others don’t want to understand, I do. You can look to me for encouragement, comfort and kindness while depression has you in its hold. \nI will do whatever you want, and whatever you need to help you feel better. You are not a burden, and you won’t push me away by feeling how you are feeling. You are the fighter, and I am your coach, ready to get you through this, but not to rush you. Take your time in feeling better, take care of your body and your mind. If you need me, I will be here, and when no one sees you, I see you."], ["created_at", "2019-02-06 04:54:20.670428"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-06 04:54:20.670428"], ["author", "Madelyn Heslet"], ["image", "https://images.pexels.com/photos/70741/cereals-field-ripe-poppy-70741.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500"]]

You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves."], ["created_at", "2019-02-06 05:06:58.078359"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-06 05:06:58.078359"], ["author", "R.

Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\n\n\tDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n\tFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\tChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\tLoss of energy or increased fatigue\n\tIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\n\tFeeling worthless or guilty\n\tDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\tThoughts of death or suicide\n\tSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\n\n\tAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\n\n\tDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.\n\n\tDepression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\n\tThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\n\n\tBut being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:\n\n\tIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.\n\tIn grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.\n\tFor some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.\n\tRisk Factors for Depression\n\tDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\n\tSeveral factors can play a role in depression:\n\n\tBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.\n\tGenetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.\n\tPersonality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.\n\tEnvironmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.\n\tHow Is Depression Treated?\n\tDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\n\n\tBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

Professor McGrath and colleagues looked at Danish health data across a record 5.9\n   \t million individuals, providing the largest and most comprehensive study of comorbidity -- \n   \t the development of two or more mental health disorders. \n   \t This long time frame enabled researchers to track a persons mental health for extended \n   \t periods of time, and resulted in the startling finding that risk of a second mental health \n   \t diagnosis remains high, even fifteen years after an initial diagnosis. \n   \t \"In the first six months after initial diagnosis, the risk of a second mental health diagnosis \n   \t is very high: so for example, people diagnosed with mood disorders like depression have a \n   \t very high risk of being diagnosed with a neurotic disorder like anxiety in the first \n   \t six months since diagnosis,\" Professor McGrath said. \"After the first year this risk drops \n   \t substantially, but it then stabilises and remains 2 or 3 times higher than those without a \n   \t prior disorder, even fifteen years after initial diagnosis.\" \"Importantly, the result was \n   \t pervasive -- we found it across all pairs of disorders that we studied.\" The findings \n   \t also suggest that for some pairs of disorders, it did not matter which one came first -- \n   \t there was an increased risk of developing the other disorders.

Importantly, people who were younger than 20 at the onset of their first \n   \t mental disorder were significantly more at risk of developing a second disorderover the \n   \t next 10-15 years, and this vulnerability was found across most pairs of disorders. \"We found \n   \t that in younger people, mental health disorders were more \"pluripotent\", meaning an observed \n   \t change or disruption in mental health was more flexible in the direction it manifested as a \n   \t disorder,\" Professor McGrath said.

It’s not easy to be happy most of the time, but there are some tips that we can apply to make us happier.\n\nHere are ten scientific ways you can change your life to make your days just a bit more joyful:\n\n1. Do More Physical Exercise\nIt is one of the most common New Year’s Resolutions, and science has proven why exercise is very important in our life. A study cited in the book: “The Happiness Advantage” also confirmed the importance of exercise on our happiness level.\n\nBasically, this study looks into three groups of depressed patients. These three groups of depressed patients are each treated with medication, exercise, or a combination of the two. Here’s what they found:\n\n“The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate. Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent!”\n\nThis study shows that exercise has the biggest effect in reducing depression.\n\nHere’s another study in the Journal of Health Psychology that also found that people who exercised are happier because they feel better about their bodies.\n\nAll the evidence has shown that the benefits of exercise include a happy life, so what are you waiting for? Start exercising now. Start small and build a habit of routine exercising, so that you will be happier.\n\n2. Get More Quality Sleep\nWe spend roughly one third of our lives sleeping, so you cannot underestimate the importance of sleep for the quality of our lifes. Here’s an interesting study in 2011 from BPS Research Digest that shows how sleep affects our happiness. The research found that people who take an afternoon nap are desensitized to negative emotions yet more responsive to positive ones.\n\nThis research shows that not only does sleep deprivation cause emotional problems, a sleep boost can bring emotional advantage. In other words, a good quality sleep does make people more positive and overally happier.\n\n3. Put down your cellphone\nA study by Kent State University surveyed more than 500 students and found that frequent cellphone use was associated with lower grades, higher anxiety, and reduced happiness.\n\n“It’s likely that people spending more time on devices have less frequent contact with live social networks, and may be more vulnerable to social comparison that leaves them with a sense of emptiness,” says Ramani Durvasula, PhD, licensed clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at California State University in Los Angeles. “And anxiety may be due to the ‘I don’t want to miss out on anything’ effect – seeing everyone else’s social calendar makes it difficult to stay present in their own lives.”\n\nEven Aristotle extolled moderation in all things. Cell phone and technology is no exception. Excessive use of even the best technologies reduces our happiness in meaningful ways. So, put down your cellphone and your happiness level will surely improve.\n\n4. Take More Social Time\nPerhaps you have heard about it before, but one of the top five regrets of the dying people is not spending enough time or staying in touch with friends and family. Spending more time with the people we care about is very beneficial to improving our happiness and our overall quality of life.\n\nDan Gilbert, a Professor of Psychology in Harvard University explains it very well:\n\n“We are happy when we have family, we are happy when we have friends and almost all the other things we think make us happy are actually just ways of getting more family and friends.”\n\nInterestingly, not only that your social relationship can make you happier, it will also make you live a richer life. A study published in the Journal of Socio-Economics used a shadow pricing method and estimates that your relationships are worth around an additional $131,232 a year.\n\nSo, just call your cousin who lives in another city and catch up with them on the phone. That will actually make you happier.\n\n5. Spend More Time Outdoors\nShawn Achor, who has lectured at Harvard University and Wharton School of Business, wrote in his book: ”The Happiness Advantage”, that spending as little as 20 minutes outside in a good weather not only boosts positive mood, but also broadens thinking and improves the working memory.\n\nAnother study from The London School of Economics and Political Science also supports this claim. It mentioned that being outdoors, near the sea, on a warm, sunny weekend afternoon is the perfect spot for most. In fact, the participants of the study were found to be substantially happier outdoors in all natural environments than they were in urban environments.\n\nIf you wonder what’s the best temperature that maximizes our happiness, you will be amazed that a research by the American Meteorological Society found that happiness is maximized at 13.9°C.\n\n6. Help others for two hours per week\nYou might be surprised to hear this, but spending money on other people (also called “prosocial spending”) boost happiness more than buying things for ourselves.\n\nA 2012 Harvard study gave away some money to participants of the study. Half of them were asked to spend it on buying things for themselves, while the other half was asked to spend the money by buying things for others. Here’s what they found:\n\n“Participants assigned to recall a purchase made for someone else reported feeling significantly happier immediately after this recollection; most importantly, the happier participants felt, the more likely they were to choose to spend a windfall on someone else in the near future. Thus, by providing initial evidence for a positive feedback loop between prosocial spending and well-being, these data offer one potential path to sustainable happiness: prosocial spending increases happiness which in turn encourages prosocial spending.”\n\nNo wonder most millionaires and billionaires are very active in philanthropy. Philanthropy has been proven to increase happiness.\n\nHelping others does not always mean you need to spend money; you can also spend your time (for example via volunteering). Here’s a study in Zurich, Switzerland that supports the notion that volunteering is rewarding in terms of higher life satisfaction.\n\nSo, how much time should you spend helping others? Buffer Blog has concluded that 100 hours per year (or two hours per week) is the optimal time we should dedicate to helping others, in order to enrich our lives and be happier\n\n7. Meditate\nYou might have heard that meditation is very important. The truth is, yes, meditation helps you improve focus, clarity, attention span,  calmness, and, you guessed it right, your happiness.\n\nA research team from Massachusetts General Hospital looked at the brain scans of 16 people before and after they participated in an eight-week course in mindfulness meditation. This study concluded that after completing the course, parts of the participants’ brains associated with compassion and self-awareness grew, and parts associated with stress shrank.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Start meditating now and you will live a happier life.\n\n8. Practice Gratitude\nGratitude is the act of being thankful for simple things in our life. Practicing gratitude has been proven to increase happiness. There’s a study from Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that suggests that a conscious focus on blessings (in other words: practicing gratitude) have emotional and interpersonal benefits. So, be grateful of the every little thing in your life, because there are a lot more people that are not as fortunate as you.\n\n9. Spend money on experience, not things\nEveryone knows that money can’t buy happiness per se, but if you’re going to spend money in search of satisfaction, splurge on an experience, not an expensive toy. A study in Psychological Science found that those who tended to spend their money on doing, as opposed to having, were better off in the long run. This effect was chalked up to the perceived superiority of anticipating an experience (like a trip) to anticipating owning an object (like shoes).\n\n10. Practice Your Spirituality Or Faith\nThough religion alone isn’t a great predictor of happiness, a study published in Frontiers In Psychology found that those who actively practiced their faith were happier than both those who had a religion but didn’t practice, and those who were non-religious. This isn’t to say that you have to be religious to be happy, but if you DO have theological inclinations, you may want to make spirituality a habit."], ["created_at", "2019-02-06 05:06:58.086787"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-06 05:06:58.086787"], ["author", "Teddy Lim"], ["image", "https://images.pexels.com/photos/248771/pexels-photo-248771.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500"]]

Depression causes you unseen pain and tortures you from the inside out. Your body hurts and your mind is tired and sometimes you just want to quit, and that’s hard for others to understand. But I promise I will try to understand, and try to help you through this. I see you, and I see you’re hurting.\n\nI see you’re lonely, but you are not alone. I am here, and will not leave until you ask me to. What can I do to help? I can offer a listening ear, a hand to hold and a shoulder to cry on.

If you take your medicine, take care of your body and let others help you, you will feel better.\n\nI see you calling your depression a weakness. Depression is not who you are. You are strong, probably stronger than you think, and you are a fighter. All fighters need someone in their corner, and I will be that for you.

I care about you, and will be with you through this. When others don’t want to listen, I will. When others don’t want to understand, I do. You can look to me for encouragement, comfort and kindness while depression has you in its hold. \nI will do whatever you want, and whatever you need to help you feel better. You are not a burden, and you won’t push me away by feeling how you are feeling. You are the fighter, and I am your coach, ready to get you through this, but not to rush you.

For example, an initial diagnosis of depression was just as likely to be followed by a second diagnosis of anxiety, and vice versa.\n\tImportantly, people who were younger than 20 at the onset of their first mental disorder were significantly more at risk of developing a second disorderover the next 10-15 years, and this vulnerability was found across most pairs of disorders.\n\t\"We found that in younger people, mental health disorders were more \"pluripotent\", meaning an observed change or disruption in mental health was more flexible in the direction it manifested as a disorder,\" Professor McGrath said.\n\tNot only is the study the largest and most comprehensive in its field, but its innovative presentation of results has set a new standard for epidemiology (the study of health and disease data), said Professor McGrath.\n\t\"The paper is open access, with all data available and code free to download, and results presented in an interactive website with educational videos,\" he said.\n\t\"It is far more user-friendly than the traditional method of presenting results purely in an academic paper.\"\n\t\"We have provided a detailed, comprehensive atlas of the ways that mental disorders cluster together available openly for public use, and we hope that this informs better practice, better clinical care, and future research.\"\n\tThe next step for Professor McGrath and his colleagues is to extend the study to identify the risks between mental disorders and the subsequent onset of general medical conditions, such as epilepsy, migraine, heart attacks, and diabetes.\n\tThe paper was published in JAMA Psychiatry and supported by the Danish National Research Foundation."], ["created_at", "2019-02-06 05:06:58.092506"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-06 05:06:58.092506"], ["author", "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190117090515.htm"], ["image", "https://images.pexels.com/photos/326055/pexels-photo-326055.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500"]]

If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle.

  Parameters: {"id"=>"2", "title"=>"What Is Depression?", "content"=>"Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\n\n\tDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n\tFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\tChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\tLoss of energy or increased fatigue\n\tIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\n\tFeeling worthless or guilty\n\tDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\tThoughts of death or suicide\n\tSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\n\n\tAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\n\n\tDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.\n\n\tDepression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\n\tThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\n\n\tBut being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:\n\n\tIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.\n\tIn grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.\n\tFor some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.\n\tRisk Factors for Depression\n\tDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\n\tSeveral factors can play a role in depression:\n\n\tBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.\n\tGenetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.\n\tPersonality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.\n\tEnvironmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.\n\tHow Is Depression Treated?\n\tDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\n\n\tBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

  Parameters: {"id"=>"2", "title"=>"What Is Depression?", "content"=>"Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\n\n\tDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n\tFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\tChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\tLoss of energy or increased fatigue\n\tIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\n\tFeeling worthless or guilty\n\tDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\tThoughts of death or suicide\n\tSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\n\n\tAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\n\n\tDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.\n\n\tDepression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\n\tThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\n\n\tBut being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:\n\n\tIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.\n\tIn grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.\n\tFor some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.\n\tRisk Factors for Depression\n\tDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\n\tSeveral factors can play a role in depression:\n\n\tBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.\n\tGenetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.\n\tPersonality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.\n\tEnvironmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.\n\tHow Is Depression Treated?\n\tDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\n\n\tBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available.

The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5.

  Parameters: {"id"=>"1", "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"id"=>"1", "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5.

Depression causes you unseen pain and tortures you from the inside out. Your body hurts and your mind is tired and sometimes you just want to quit, and that’s hard for others to understand. But I promise I will try to understand, and try to help you through this. I see you, and I see you’re hurting.\n\nI see you’re lonely, but you are not alone. I am here, and will not leave until you ask me to. What can I do to help? I can offer a listening ear, a hand to hold and a shoulder to cry on. I can show you funny YouTube videos to make you laugh, or encourage you with my favorite uplifting quotes from Pinterest. If you don’t want any of that, if you don’t want to talk, that’s OK. I can make you a cup of tea, turn on Netflix and sit here quietly. But I’m still here.\n\nI see you doubting yourself, but please don’t. You are my sister and part of my heart. You matter, and how you feel is important. You are not unlovable, you are not unwanted. I know you feel like that right now, but that’s the depression talking. You are loved, you are wanted and your life is valuable. You are important to me, and what you’re feeling is valid.\n\nPlease don’t doubt yourself; you are loving, you are kind and you are beautiful, whether you are depressed or not.\n\nI see that it’s hard for you to get out of bed today, and that’s OK. But when you do get out of bed, celebrate. It’s the small victories that will help you get through this. Taking a shower and doing the dishes seem daunting, I know. Take your daily tasks one step at a time. Do you need help? Let me do the dishes. Tell me what else you need me to do today. If you need me to, I will encourage you to stay out of bed. If you want to stay in bed today, that’s OK, but try and get out of bed tomorrow.\nI see you blaming yourself for how you’re feeling, but it’s not your fault. You’re not choosing to be depressed, depression has chosen you. Being depressed is kind of like having the flu. When you’re sick, you forget how good you felt before. When you’re depressed, you forget what it’s like to be happy. But just like the flu, you will feel better. If you take your medicine, take care of your body and let others help you, you will feel better.\n\nI see you calling your depression a weakness. Depression is not who you are. You are strong, probably stronger than you think, and you are a fighter. All fighters need someone in their corner, and I will be that for you. I will be here to remind you that you are not weak, and help give you the strength you need to fight through this.\n\nDuring the times you feel small and unable to be seen, I want you to know I see you, and I see your pain. I care about you, and will be with you through this. When others don’t want to listen, I will. When others don’t want to understand, I do. You can look to me for encouragement, comfort and kindness while depression has you in its hold. \nI will do whatever you want, and whatever you need to help you feel better. You are not a burden, and you won’t push me away by feeling how you are feeling. You are the fighter, and I am your coach, ready to get you through this, but not to rush you.

Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle.

  Parameters: {"id"=>"1", "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV.

Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle.

If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5.

  Parameters: {"id"=>"1", "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"id"=>"1", "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5.

  Parameters: {"id"=>"1", "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"id"=>"1", "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD.

To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5.

  Parameters: {"id"=>"1", "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>4, "title"=>"Happiness Hack: 10 Ways to Be Happier Backed by Science", "content"=>"\nHappiness is an elusive goal; everyone seems to want it, but if it were easy to attain, the whole world would be happy and we wouldn’t need to keep searching for it. It’s not easy to be happy most of the time, but there are some tips that we can apply to make us happier.\n\nHere are ten scientific ways you can change your life to make your days just a bit more joyful:\n\n1. Do More Physical Exercise\nIt is one of the most common New Year’s Resolutions, and science has proven why exercise is very important in our life. A study cited in the book: “The Happiness Advantage” also confirmed the importance of exercise on our happiness level.\n\nBasically, this study looks into three groups of depressed patients. These three groups of depressed patients are each treated with medication, exercise, or a combination of the two. Here’s what they found:\n\n“The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate. Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent!”\n\nThis study shows that exercise has the biggest effect in reducing depression.\n\nHere’s another study in the Journal of Health Psychology that also found that people who exercised are happier because they feel better about their bodies.\n\nAll the evidence has shown that the benefits of exercise include a happy life, so what are you waiting for? Start exercising now. Start small and build a habit of routine exercising, so that you will be happier.\n\n2. Get More Quality Sleep\nWe spend roughly one third of our lives sleeping, so you cannot underestimate the importance of sleep for the quality of our lifes. Here’s an interesting study in 2011 from BPS Research Digest that shows how sleep affects our happiness. The research found that people who take an afternoon nap are desensitized to negative emotions yet more responsive to positive ones.\n\nThis research shows that not only does sleep deprivation cause emotional problems, a sleep boost can bring emotional advantage. In other words, a good quality sleep does make people more positive and overally happier.\n\n3. Put down your cellphone\nA study by Kent State University surveyed more than 500 students and found that frequent cellphone use was associated with lower grades, higher anxiety, and reduced happiness.\n\n“It’s likely that people spending more time on devices have less frequent contact with live social networks, and may be more vulnerable to social comparison that leaves them with a sense of emptiness,” says Ramani Durvasula, PhD, licensed clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at California State University in Los Angeles. “And anxiety may be due to the ‘I don’t want to miss out on anything’ effect – seeing everyone else’s social calendar makes it difficult to stay present in their own lives.”\n\nEven Aristotle extolled moderation in all things. Cell phone and technology is no exception. Excessive use of even the best technologies reduces our happiness in meaningful ways. So, put down your cellphone and your happiness level will surely improve.\n\n4. Take More Social Time\nPerhaps you have heard about it before, but one of the top five regrets of the dying people is not spending enough time or staying in touch with friends and family. Spending more time with the people we care about is very beneficial to improving our happiness and our overall quality of life.\n\nDan Gilbert, a Professor of Psychology in Harvard University explains it very well:\n\n“We are happy when we have family, we are happy when we have friends and almost all the other things we think make us happy are actually just ways of getting more family and friends.”\n\nInterestingly, not only that your social relationship can make you happier, it will also make you live a richer life. A study published in the Journal of Socio-Economics used a shadow pricing method and estimates that your relationships are worth around an additional $131,232 a year.\n\nSo, just call your cousin who lives in another city and catch up with them on the phone. That will actually make you happier.\n\n5. Spend More Time Outdoors\nShawn Achor, who has lectured at Harvard University and Wharton School of Business, wrote in his book: ”The Happiness Advantage”, that spending as little as 20 minutes outside in a good weather not only boosts positive mood, but also broadens thinking and improves the working memory.\n\nAnother study from The London School of Economics and Political Science also supports this claim. It mentioned that being outdoors, near the sea, on a warm, sunny weekend afternoon is the perfect spot for most. In fact, the participants of the study were found to be substantially happier outdoors in all natural environments than they were in urban environments.\n\nIf you wonder what’s the best temperature that maximizes our happiness, you will be amazed that a research by the American Meteorological Society found that happiness is maximized at 13.9°C.\n\n6. Help others for two hours per week\nYou might be surprised to hear this, but spending money on other people (also called “prosocial spending”) boost happiness more than buying things for ourselves.\n\nA 2012 Harvard study gave away some money to participants of the study. Half of them were asked to spend it on buying things for themselves, while the other half was asked to spend the money by buying things for others. Here’s what they found:\n\n“Participants assigned to recall a purchase made for someone else reported feeling significantly happier immediately after this recollection; most importantly, the happier participants felt, the more likely they were to choose to spend a windfall on someone else in the near future. Thus, by providing initial evidence for a positive feedback loop between prosocial spending and well-being, these data offer one potential path to sustainable happiness: prosocial spending increases happiness which in turn encourages prosocial spending.”\n\nNo wonder most millionaires and billionaires are very active in philanthropy. Philanthropy has been proven to increase happiness.\n\nHelping others does not always mean you need to spend money; you can also spend your time (for example via volunteering). Here’s a study in Zurich, Switzerland that supports the notion that volunteering is rewarding in terms of higher life satisfaction.\n\nSo, how much time should you spend helping others? Buffer Blog has concluded that 100 hours per year (or two hours per week) is the optimal time we should dedicate to helping others, in order to enrich our lives and be happier\n\n7. Meditate\nYou might have heard that meditation is very important. The truth is, yes, meditation helps you improve focus, clarity, attention span,  calmness, and, you guessed it right, your happiness.\n\nA research team from Massachusetts General Hospital looked at the brain scans of 16 people before and after they participated in an eight-week course in mindfulness meditation. This study concluded that after completing the course, parts of the participants’ brains associated with compassion and self-awareness grew, and parts associated with stress shrank.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Start meditating now and you will live a happier life.\n\n8. Practice Gratitude\nGratitude is the act of being thankful for simple things in our life. Practicing gratitude has been proven to increase happiness. There’s a study from Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that suggests that a conscious focus on blessings (in other words: practicing gratitude) have emotional and interpersonal benefits. So, be grateful of the every little thing in your life, because there are a lot more people that are not as fortunate as you.\n\n9. Spend money on experience, not things\nEveryone knows that money can’t buy happiness per se, but if you’re going to spend money in search of satisfaction, splurge on an experience, not an expensive toy. A study in Psychological Science found that those who tended to spend their money on doing, as opposed to having, were better off in the long run. This effect was chalked up to the perceived superiority of anticipating an experience (like a trip) to anticipating owning an object (like shoes).\n\n10. Practice Your Spirituality Or Faith\nThough religion alone isn’t a great predictor of happiness, a study published in Frontiers In Psychology found that those who actively practiced their faith were happier than both those who had a religion but didn’t practice, and those who were non-religious. This isn’t to say that you have to be religious to be happy, but if you DO have theological inclinations, you may want to make spirituality a habit.", "author"=>"Teddy Lim", "created_at"=>"2019-02-06T05:06:58.086Z", "image"=>"https://images.pexels.com/photos/248771/pexels-photo-248771.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500", "likes"=>1}, "id"=>"4"}

It mentioned that being outdoors, near the sea, on a warm, sunny weekend afternoon is the perfect spot for most. In fact, the participants of the study were found to be substantially happier outdoors in all natural environments than they were in urban environments.\n\nIf you wonder what’s the best temperature that maximizes our happiness, you will be amazed that a research by the American Meteorological Society found that happiness is maximized at 13.9°C.\n\n6. Help others for two hours per week\nYou might be surprised to hear this, but spending money on other people (also called “prosocial spending”) boost happiness more than buying things for ourselves.\n\nA 2012 Harvard study gave away some money to participants of the study. Half of them were asked to spend it on buying things for themselves, while the other half was asked to spend the money by buying things for others. Here’s what they found:\n\n“Participants assigned to recall a purchase made for someone else reported feeling significantly happier immediately after this recollection; most importantly, the happier participants felt, the more likely they were to choose to spend a windfall on someone else in the near future. Thus, by providing initial evidence for a positive feedback loop between prosocial spending and well-being, these data offer one potential path to sustainable happiness: prosocial spending increases happiness which in turn encourages prosocial spending.”\n\nNo wonder most millionaires and billionaires are very active in philanthropy. Philanthropy has been proven to increase happiness.\n\nHelping others does not always mean you need to spend money; you can also spend your time (for example via volunteering). Here’s a study in Zurich, Switzerland that supports the notion that volunteering is rewarding in terms of higher life satisfaction.\n\nSo, how much time should you spend helping others? Buffer Blog has concluded that 100 hours per year (or two hours per week) is the optimal time we should dedicate to helping others, in order to enrich our lives and be happier\n\n7. Meditate\nYou might have heard that meditation is very important. The truth is, yes, meditation helps you improve focus, clarity, attention span,  calmness, and, you guessed it right, your happiness.\n\nA research team from Massachusetts General Hospital looked at the brain scans of 16 people before and after they participated in an eight-week course in mindfulness meditation. This study concluded that after completing the course, parts of the participants’ brains associated with compassion and self-awareness grew, and parts associated with stress shrank.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Start meditating now and you will live a happier life.\n\n8. Practice Gratitude\nGratitude is the act of being thankful for simple things in our life. Practicing gratitude has been proven to increase happiness. There’s a study from Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that suggests that a conscious focus on blessings (in other words: practicing gratitude) have emotional and interpersonal benefits. So, be grateful of the every little thing in your life, because there are a lot more people that are not as fortunate as you.\n\n9. Spend money on experience, not things\nEveryone knows that money can’t buy happiness per se, but if you’re going to spend money in search of satisfaction, splurge on an experience, not an expensive toy. A study in Psychological Science found that those who tended to spend their money on doing, as opposed to having, were better off in the long run. This effect was chalked up to the perceived superiority of anticipating an experience (like a trip) to anticipating owning an object (like shoes).\n\n10. Practice Your Spirituality Or Faith\nThough religion alone isn’t a great predictor of happiness, a study published in Frontiers In Psychology found that those who actively practiced their faith were happier than both those who had a religion but didn’t practice, and those who were non-religious. This isn’t to say that you have to be religious to be happy, but if you DO have theological inclinations, you may want to make spirituality a habit.", "author"=>"Teddy Lim", "created_at"=>"2019-02-06T05:06:58.086Z", "image"=>"https://images.pexels.com/photos/248771/pexels-photo-248771.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500", "likes"=>2}, "id"=>"4"}

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>4, "title"=>"Happiness Hack: 10 Ways to Be Happier Backed by Science", "content"=>"\nHappiness is an elusive goal; everyone seems to want it, but if it were easy to attain, the whole world would be happy and we wouldn’t need to keep searching for it. It’s not easy to be happy most of the time, but there are some tips that we can apply to make us happier.\n\nHere are ten scientific ways you can change your life to make your days just a bit more joyful:\n\n1. Do More Physical Exercise\nIt is one of the most common New Year’s Resolutions, and science has proven why exercise is very important in our life. A study cited in the book: “The Happiness Advantage” also confirmed the importance of exercise on our happiness level.\n\nBasically, this study looks into three groups of depressed patients. These three groups of depressed patients are each treated with medication, exercise, or a combination of the two. Here’s what they found:\n\n“The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate. Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent!”\n\nThis study shows that exercise has the biggest effect in reducing depression.\n\nHere’s another study in the Journal of Health Psychology that also found that people who exercised are happier because they feel better about their bodies.\n\nAll the evidence has shown that the benefits of exercise include a happy life, so what are you waiting for? Start exercising now. Start small and build a habit of routine exercising, so that you will be happier.\n\n2. Get More Quality Sleep\nWe spend roughly one third of our lives sleeping, so you cannot underestimate the importance of sleep for the quality of our lifes. Here’s an interesting study in 2011 from BPS Research Digest that shows how sleep affects our happiness. The research found that people who take an afternoon nap are desensitized to negative emotions yet more responsive to positive ones.\n\nThis research shows that not only does sleep deprivation cause emotional problems, a sleep boost can bring emotional advantage. In other words, a good quality sleep does make people more positive and overally happier.\n\n3. Put down your cellphone\nA study by Kent State University surveyed more than 500 students and found that frequent cellphone use was associated with lower grades, higher anxiety, and reduced happiness.\n\n“It’s likely that people spending more time on devices have less frequent contact with live social networks, and may be more vulnerable to social comparison that leaves them with a sense of emptiness,” says Ramani Durvasula, PhD, licensed clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at California State University in Los Angeles. “And anxiety may be due to the ‘I don’t want to miss out on anything’ effect – seeing everyone else’s social calendar makes it difficult to stay present in their own lives.”\n\nEven Aristotle extolled moderation in all things. Cell phone and technology is no exception. Excessive use of even the best technologies reduces our happiness in meaningful ways. So, put down your cellphone and your happiness level will surely improve.\n\n4. Take More Social Time\nPerhaps you have heard about it before, but one of the top five regrets of the dying people is not spending enough time or staying in touch with friends and family. Spending more time with the people we care about is very beneficial to improving our happiness and our overall quality of life.\n\nDan Gilbert, a Professor of Psychology in Harvard University explains it very well:\n\n“We are happy when we have family, we are happy when we have friends and almost all the other things we think make us happy are actually just ways of getting more family and friends.”\n\nInterestingly, not only that your social relationship can make you happier, it will also make you live a richer life. A study published in the Journal of Socio-Economics used a shadow pricing method and estimates that your relationships are worth around an additional $131,232 a year.\n\nSo, just call your cousin who lives in another city and catch up with them on the phone. That will actually make you happier.\n\n5. Spend More Time Outdoors\nShawn Achor, who has lectured at Harvard University and Wharton School of Business, wrote in his book: ”The Happiness Advantage”, that spending as little as 20 minutes outside in a good weather not only boosts positive mood, but also broadens thinking and improves the working memory.\n\nAnother study from The London School of Economics and Political Science also supports this claim.

The truth is, yes, meditation helps you improve focus, clarity, attention span,  calmness, and, you guessed it right, your happiness.\n\nA research team from Massachusetts General Hospital looked at the brain scans of 16 people before and after they participated in an eight-week course in mindfulness meditation. This study concluded that after completing the course, parts of the participants’ brains associated with compassion and self-awareness grew, and parts associated with stress shrank.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Start meditating now and you will live a happier life.\n\n8. Practice Gratitude\nGratitude is the act of being thankful for simple things in our life. Practicing gratitude has been proven to increase happiness. There’s a study from Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that suggests that a conscious focus on blessings (in other words: practicing gratitude) have emotional and interpersonal benefits. So, be grateful of the every little thing in your life, because there are a lot more people that are not as fortunate as you.\n\n9. Spend money on experience, not things\nEveryone knows that money can’t buy happiness per se, but if you’re going to spend money in search of satisfaction, splurge on an experience, not an expensive toy. A study in Psychological Science found that those who tended to spend their money on doing, as opposed to having, were better off in the long run. This effect was chalked up to the perceived superiority of anticipating an experience (like a trip) to anticipating owning an object (like shoes).\n\n10. Practice Your Spirituality Or Faith\nThough religion alone isn’t a great predictor of happiness, a study published in Frontiers In Psychology found that those who actively practiced their faith were happier than both those who had a religion but didn’t practice, and those who were non-religious. This isn’t to say that you have to be religious to be happy, but if you DO have theological inclinations, you may want to make spirituality a habit.", "author"=>"Teddy Lim", "created_at"=>"2019-02-06T05:06:58.086Z", "image"=>"https://images.pexels.com/photos/248771/pexels-photo-248771.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500", "likes"=>5}, "id"=>"4"}

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>4, "title"=>"Happiness Hack: 10 Ways to Be Happier Backed by Science", "content"=>"\nHappiness is an elusive goal; everyone seems to want it, but if it were easy to attain, the whole world would be happy and we wouldn’t need to keep searching for it. It’s not easy to be happy most of the time, but there are some tips that we can apply to make us happier.\n\nHere are ten scientific ways you can change your life to make your days just a bit more joyful:\n\n1. Do More Physical Exercise\nIt is one of the most common New Year’s Resolutions, and science has proven why exercise is very important in our life. A study cited in the book: “The Happiness Advantage” also confirmed the importance of exercise on our happiness level.\n\nBasically, this study looks into three groups of depressed patients. These three groups of depressed patients are each treated with medication, exercise, or a combination of the two. Here’s what they found:\n\n“The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate. Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent!”\n\nThis study shows that exercise has the biggest effect in reducing depression.\n\nHere’s another study in the Journal of Health Psychology that also found that people who exercised are happier because they feel better about their bodies.\n\nAll the evidence has shown that the benefits of exercise include a happy life, so what are you waiting for? Start exercising now. Start small and build a habit of routine exercising, so that you will be happier.\n\n2. Get More Quality Sleep\nWe spend roughly one third of our lives sleeping, so you cannot underestimate the importance of sleep for the quality of our lifes. Here’s an interesting study in 2011 from BPS Research Digest that shows how sleep affects our happiness. The research found that people who take an afternoon nap are desensitized to negative emotions yet more responsive to positive ones.\n\nThis research shows that not only does sleep deprivation cause emotional problems, a sleep boost can bring emotional advantage. In other words, a good quality sleep does make people more positive and overally happier.\n\n3. Put down your cellphone\nA study by Kent State University surveyed more than 500 students and found that frequent cellphone use was associated with lower grades, higher anxiety, and reduced happiness.\n\n“It’s likely that people spending more time on devices have less frequent contact with live social networks, and may be more vulnerable to social comparison that leaves them with a sense of emptiness,” says Ramani Durvasula, PhD, licensed clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at California State University in Los Angeles. “And anxiety may be due to the ‘I don’t want to miss out on anything’ effect – seeing everyone else’s social calendar makes it difficult to stay present in their own lives.”\n\nEven Aristotle extolled moderation in all things. Cell phone and technology is no exception. Excessive use of even the best technologies reduces our happiness in meaningful ways. So, put down your cellphone and your happiness level will surely improve.\n\n4. Take More Social Time\nPerhaps you have heard about it before, but one of the top five regrets of the dying people is not spending enough time or staying in touch with friends and family. Spending more time with the people we care about is very beneficial to improving our happiness and our overall quality of life.\n\nDan Gilbert, a Professor of Psychology in Harvard University explains it very well:\n\n“We are happy when we have family, we are happy when we have friends and almost all the other things we think make us happy are actually just ways of getting more family and friends.”\n\nInterestingly, not only that your social relationship can make you happier, it will also make you live a richer life. A study published in the Journal of Socio-Economics used a shadow pricing method and estimates that your relationships are worth around an additional $131,232 a year.\n\nSo, just call your cousin who lives in another city and catch up with them on the phone. That will actually make you happier.\n\n5. Spend More Time Outdoors\nShawn Achor, who has lectured at Harvard University and Wharton School of Business, wrote in his book: ”The Happiness Advantage”, that spending as little as 20 minutes outside in a good weather not only boosts positive mood, but also broadens thinking and improves the working memory.\n\nAnother study from The London School of Economics and Political Science also supports this claim. It mentioned that being outdoors, near the sea, on a warm, sunny weekend afternoon is the perfect spot for most. In fact, the participants of the study were found to be substantially happier outdoors in all natural environments than they were in urban environments.\n\nIf you wonder what’s the best temperature that maximizes our happiness, you will be amazed that a research by the American Meteorological Society found that happiness is maximized at 13.9°C.\n\n6. Help others for two hours per week\nYou might be surprised to hear this, but spending money on other people (also called “prosocial spending”) boost happiness more than buying things for ourselves.\n\nA 2012 Harvard study gave away some money to participants of the study. Half of them were asked to spend it on buying things for themselves, while the other half was asked to spend the money by buying things for others. Here’s what they found:\n\n“Participants assigned to recall a purchase made for someone else reported feeling significantly happier immediately after this recollection; most importantly, the happier participants felt, the more likely they were to choose to spend a windfall on someone else in the near future. Thus, by providing initial evidence for a positive feedback loop between prosocial spending and well-being, these data offer one potential path to sustainable happiness: prosocial spending increases happiness which in turn encourages prosocial spending.”\n\nNo wonder most millionaires and billionaires are very active in philanthropy. Philanthropy has been proven to increase happiness.\n\nHelping others does not always mean you need to spend money; you can also spend your time (for example via volunteering). Here’s a study in Zurich, Switzerland that supports the notion that volunteering is rewarding in terms of higher life satisfaction.\n\nSo, how much time should you spend helping others? Buffer Blog has concluded that 100 hours per year (or two hours per week) is the optimal time we should dedicate to helping others, in order to enrich our lives and be happier\n\n7. Meditate\nYou might have heard that meditation is very important.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>4, "title"=>"Happiness Hack: 10 Ways to Be Happier Backed by Science", "content"=>"\nHappiness is an elusive goal; everyone seems to want it, but if it were easy to attain, the whole world would be happy and we wouldn’t need to keep searching for it. It’s not easy to be happy most of the time, but there are some tips that we can apply to make us happier.\n\nHere are ten scientific ways you can change your life to make your days just a bit more joyful:\n\n1. Do More Physical Exercise\nIt is one of the most common New Year’s Resolutions, and science has proven why exercise is very important in our life. A study cited in the book: “The Happiness Advantage” also confirmed the importance of exercise on our happiness level.\n\nBasically, this study looks into three groups of depressed patients. These three groups of depressed patients are each treated with medication, exercise, or a combination of the two. Here’s what they found:\n\n“The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate. Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent!”\n\nThis study shows that exercise has the biggest effect in reducing depression.\n\nHere’s another study in the Journal of Health Psychology that also found that people who exercised are happier because they feel better about their bodies.\n\nAll the evidence has shown that the benefits of exercise include a happy life, so what are you waiting for? Start exercising now. Start small and build a habit of routine exercising, so that you will be happier.\n\n2. Get More Quality Sleep\nWe spend roughly one third of our lives sleeping, so you cannot underestimate the importance of sleep for the quality of our lifes. Here’s an interesting study in 2011 from BPS Research Digest that shows how sleep affects our happiness. The research found that people who take an afternoon nap are desensitized to negative emotions yet more responsive to positive ones.\n\nThis research shows that not only does sleep deprivation cause emotional problems, a sleep boost can bring emotional advantage. In other words, a good quality sleep does make people more positive and overally happier.\n\n3. Put down your cellphone\nA study by Kent State University surveyed more than 500 students and found that frequent cellphone use was associated with lower grades, higher anxiety, and reduced happiness.\n\n“It’s likely that people spending more time on devices have less frequent contact with live social networks, and may be more vulnerable to social comparison that leaves them with a sense of emptiness,” says Ramani Durvasula, PhD, licensed clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at California State University in Los Angeles. “And anxiety may be due to the ‘I don’t want to miss out on anything’ effect – seeing everyone else’s social calendar makes it difficult to stay present in their own lives.”\n\nEven Aristotle extolled moderation in all things. Cell phone and technology is no exception. Excessive use of even the best technologies reduces our happiness in meaningful ways. So, put down your cellphone and your happiness level will surely improve.\n\n4. Take More Social Time\nPerhaps you have heard about it before, but one of the top five regrets of the dying people is not spending enough time or staying in touch with friends and family. Spending more time with the people we care about is very beneficial to improving our happiness and our overall quality of life.\n\nDan Gilbert, a Professor of Psychology in Harvard University explains it very well:\n\n“We are happy when we have family, we are happy when we have friends and almost all the other things we think make us happy are actually just ways of getting more family and friends.”\n\nInterestingly, not only that your social relationship can make you happier, it will also make you live a richer life. A study published in the Journal of Socio-Economics used a shadow pricing method and estimates that your relationships are worth around an additional $131,232 a year.\n\nSo, just call your cousin who lives in another city and catch up with them on the phone. That will actually make you happier.\n\n5. Spend More Time Outdoors\nShawn Achor, who has lectured at Harvard University and Wharton School of Business, wrote in his book: ”The Happiness Advantage”, that spending as little as 20 minutes outside in a good weather not only boosts positive mood, but also broadens thinking and improves the working memory.\n\nAnother study from The London School of Economics and Political Science also supports this claim. It mentioned that being outdoors, near the sea, on a warm, sunny weekend afternoon is the perfect spot for most. In fact, the participants of the study were found to be substantially happier outdoors in all natural environments than they were in urban environments.\n\nIf you wonder what’s the best temperature that maximizes our happiness, you will be amazed that a research by the American Meteorological Society found that happiness is maximized at 13.9°C.\n\n6. Help others for two hours per week\nYou might be surprised to hear this, but spending money on other people (also called “prosocial spending”) boost happiness more than buying things for ourselves.\n\nA 2012 Harvard study gave away some money to participants of the study. Half of them were asked to spend it on buying things for themselves, while the other half was asked to spend the money by buying things for others. Here’s what they found:\n\n“Participants assigned to recall a purchase made for someone else reported feeling significantly happier immediately after this recollection; most importantly, the happier participants felt, the more likely they were to choose to spend a windfall on someone else in the near future. Thus, by providing initial evidence for a positive feedback loop between prosocial spending and well-being, these data offer one potential path to sustainable happiness: prosocial spending increases happiness which in turn encourages prosocial spending.”\n\nNo wonder most millionaires and billionaires are very active in philanthropy. Philanthropy has been proven to increase happiness.\n\nHelping others does not always mean you need to spend money; you can also spend your time (for example via volunteering). Here’s a study in Zurich, Switzerland that supports the notion that volunteering is rewarding in terms of higher life satisfaction.\n\nSo, how much time should you spend helping others? Buffer Blog has concluded that 100 hours per year (or two hours per week) is the optimal time we should dedicate to helping others, in order to enrich our lives and be happier\n\n7. Meditate\nYou might have heard that meditation is very important. The truth is, yes, meditation helps you improve focus, clarity, attention span,  calmness, and, you guessed it right, your happiness.\n\nA research team from Massachusetts General Hospital looked at the brain scans of 16 people before and after they participated in an eight-week course in mindfulness meditation. This study concluded that after completing the course, parts of the participants’ brains associated with compassion and self-awareness grew, and parts associated with stress shrank.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Start meditating now and you will live a happier life.\n\n8. Practice Gratitude\nGratitude is the act of being thankful for simple things in our life. Practicing gratitude has been proven to increase happiness. There’s a study from Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that suggests that a conscious focus on blessings (in other words: practicing gratitude) have emotional and interpersonal benefits. So, be grateful of the every little thing in your life, because there are a lot more people that are not as fortunate as you.\n\n9. Spend money on experience, not things\nEveryone knows that money can’t buy happiness per se, but if you’re going to spend money in search of satisfaction, splurge on an experience, not an expensive toy. A study in Psychological Science found that those who tended to spend their money on doing, as opposed to having, were better off in the long run. This effect was chalked up to the perceived superiority of anticipating an experience (like a trip) to anticipating owning an object (like shoes).\n\n10.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>4, "title"=>"Happiness Hack: 10 Ways to Be Happier Backed by Science", "content"=>"\nHappiness is an elusive goal; everyone seems to want it, but if it were easy to attain, the whole world would be happy and we wouldn’t need to keep searching for it. It’s not easy to be happy most of the time, but there are some tips that we can apply to make us happier.\n\nHere are ten scientific ways you can change your life to make your days just a bit more joyful:\n\n1. Do More Physical Exercise\nIt is one of the most common New Year’s Resolutions, and science has proven why exercise is very important in our life. A study cited in the book: “The Happiness Advantage” also confirmed the importance of exercise on our happiness level.\n\nBasically, this study looks into three groups of depressed patients. These three groups of depressed patients are each treated with medication, exercise, or a combination of the two. Here’s what they found:\n\n“The groups were then tested six months later to assess their relapse rate. Of those who had taken the medication alone, 38 percent had slipped back into depression. Those in the combination group were doing only slightly better, with a 31 percent relapse rate. The biggest shock, though, came from the exercise group: Their relapse rate was only 9 percent!”\n\nThis study shows that exercise has the biggest effect in reducing depression.\n\nHere’s another study in the Journal of Health Psychology that also found that people who exercised are happier because they feel better about their bodies.\n\nAll the evidence has shown that the benefits of exercise include a happy life, so what are you waiting for? Start exercising now. Start small and build a habit of routine exercising, so that you will be happier.\n\n2. Get More Quality Sleep\nWe spend roughly one third of our lives sleeping, so you cannot underestimate the importance of sleep for the quality of our lifes. Here’s an interesting study in 2011 from BPS Research Digest that shows how sleep affects our happiness. The research found that people who take an afternoon nap are desensitized to negative emotions yet more responsive to positive ones.\n\nThis research shows that not only does sleep deprivation cause emotional problems, a sleep boost can bring emotional advantage. In other words, a good quality sleep does make people more positive and overally happier.\n\n3. Put down your cellphone\nA study by Kent State University surveyed more than 500 students and found that frequent cellphone use was associated with lower grades, higher anxiety, and reduced happiness.\n\n“It’s likely that people spending more time on devices have less frequent contact with live social networks, and may be more vulnerable to social comparison that leaves them with a sense of emptiness,” says Ramani Durvasula, PhD, licensed clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at California State University in Los Angeles. “And anxiety may be due to the ‘I don’t want to miss out on anything’ effect – seeing everyone else’s social calendar makes it difficult to stay present in their own lives.”\n\nEven Aristotle extolled moderation in all things. Cell phone and technology is no exception. Excessive use of even the best technologies reduces our happiness in meaningful ways. So, put down your cellphone and your happiness level will surely improve.\n\n4. Take More Social Time\nPerhaps you have heard about it before, but one of the top five regrets of the dying people is not spending enough time or staying in touch with friends and family. Spending more time with the people we care about is very beneficial to improving our happiness and our overall quality of life.\n\nDan Gilbert, a Professor of Psychology in Harvard University explains it very well:\n\n“We are happy when we have family, we are happy when we have friends and almost all the other things we think make us happy are actually just ways of getting more family and friends.”\n\nInterestingly, not only that your social relationship can make you happier, it will also make you live a richer life. A study published in the Journal of Socio-Economics used a shadow pricing method and estimates that your relationships are worth around an additional $131,232 a year.\n\nSo, just call your cousin who lives in another city and catch up with them on the phone. That will actually make you happier.\n\n5. Spend More Time Outdoors\nShawn Achor, who has lectured at Harvard University and Wharton School of Business, wrote in his book: ”The Happiness Advantage”, that spending as little as 20 minutes outside in a good weather not only boosts positive mood, but also broadens thinking and improves the working memory.\n\nAnother study from The London School of Economics and Political Science also supports this claim. It mentioned that being outdoors, near the sea, on a warm, sunny weekend afternoon is the perfect spot for most. In fact, the participants of the study were found to be substantially happier outdoors in all natural environments than they were in urban environments.\n\nIf you wonder what’s the best temperature that maximizes our happiness, you will be amazed that a research by the American Meteorological Society found that happiness is maximized at 13.9°C.\n\n6. Help others for two hours per week\nYou might be surprised to hear this, but spending money on other people (also called “prosocial spending”) boost happiness more than buying things for ourselves.\n\nA 2012 Harvard study gave away some money to participants of the study. Half of them were asked to spend it on buying things for themselves, while the other half was asked to spend the money by buying things for others. Here’s what they found:\n\n“Participants assigned to recall a purchase made for someone else reported feeling significantly happier immediately after this recollection; most importantly, the happier participants felt, the more likely they were to choose to spend a windfall on someone else in the near future. Thus, by providing initial evidence for a positive feedback loop between prosocial spending and well-being, these data offer one potential path to sustainable happiness: prosocial spending increases happiness which in turn encourages prosocial spending.”\n\nNo wonder most millionaires and billionaires are very active in philanthropy. Philanthropy has been proven to increase happiness.\n\nHelping others does not always mean you need to spend money; you can also spend your time (for example via volunteering). Here’s a study in Zurich, Switzerland that supports the notion that volunteering is rewarding in terms of higher life satisfaction.\n\nSo, how much time should you spend helping others? Buffer Blog has concluded that 100 hours per year (or two hours per week) is the optimal time we should dedicate to helping others, in order to enrich our lives and be happier\n\n7. Meditate\nYou might have heard that meditation is very important. The truth is, yes, meditation helps you improve focus, clarity, attention span,  calmness, and, you guessed it right, your happiness.\n\nA research team from Massachusetts General Hospital looked at the brain scans of 16 people before and after they participated in an eight-week course in mindfulness meditation. This study concluded that after completing the course, parts of the participants’ brains associated with compassion and self-awareness grew, and parts associated with stress shrank.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Start meditating now and you will live a happier life.\n\n8. Practice Gratitude\nGratitude is the act of being thankful for simple things in our life. Practicing gratitude has been proven to increase happiness. There’s a study from Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that suggests that a conscious focus on blessings (in other words: practicing gratitude) have emotional and interpersonal benefits. So, be grateful of the every little thing in your life, because there are a lot more people that are not as fortunate as you.\n\n9. Spend money on experience, not things\nEveryone knows that money can’t buy happiness per se, but if you’re going to spend money in search of satisfaction, splurge on an experience, not an expensive toy. A study in Psychological Science found that those who tended to spend their money on doing, as opposed to having, were better off in the long run. This effect was chalked up to the perceived superiority of anticipating an experience (like a trip) to anticipating owning an object (like shoes).\n\n10. Practice Your Spirituality Or Faith\nThough religion alone isn’t a great predictor of happiness, a study published in Frontiers In Psychology found that those who actively practiced their faith were happier than both those who had a religion but didn’t practice, and those who were non-religious. This isn’t to say that you have to be religious to be happy, but if you DO have theological inclinations, you may want to make spirituality a habit.", "author"=>"Teddy Lim", "created_at"=>"2019-02-06T05:06:58.086Z", "image"=>"https://images.pexels.com/photos/248771/pexels-photo-248771.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500", "likes"=>12}, "id"=>"4"}

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"id"=>"2", "title"=>"What Is Depression?", "content"=>"Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\n\n\tDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n\tFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\tChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\tLoss of energy or increased fatigue\n\tIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\n\tFeeling worthless or guilty\n\tDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\tThoughts of death or suicide\n\tSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\n\n\tAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\n\n\tDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.\n\n\tDepression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\n\tThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\n\n\tBut being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:\n\n\tIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.\n\tIn grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.\n\tFor some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.\n\tRisk Factors for Depression\n\tDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\n\tSeveral factors can play a role in depression:\n\n\tBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.\n\tGenetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.\n\tPersonality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.\n\tEnvironmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.\n\tHow Is Depression Treated?\n\tDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\n\n\tBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

  Parameters: {"id"=>"1", "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle.

  Parameters: {"id"=>"1", "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1.

Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD.

Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5.

Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>2, "title"=>"What Is Depression?", "content"=>"Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\n\n\tDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n\tFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\tChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\tLoss of energy or increased fatigue\n\tIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\n\tFeeling worthless or guilty\n\tDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\tThoughts of death or suicide\n\tSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\n\n\tAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\n\n\tDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.\n\n\tDepression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\n\tThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\n\n\tBut being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:\n\n\tIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.\n\tIn grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.\n\tFor some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.\n\tRisk Factors for Depression\n\tDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\n\tSeveral factors can play a role in depression:\n\n\tBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.\n\tGenetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.\n\tPersonality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.\n\tEnvironmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.\n\tHow Is Depression Treated?\n\tDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\n\n\tBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit.

If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>2, "title"=>"What Is Depression?", "content"=>"Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\n\n\tDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n\tFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\tChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\tLoss of energy or increased fatigue\n\tIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\n\tFeeling worthless or guilty\n\tDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\tThoughts of death or suicide\n\tSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\n\n\tAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\n\n\tDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.\n\n\tDepression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\n\tThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\n\n\tBut being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:\n\n\tIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.\n\tIn grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.\n\tFor some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.\n\tRisk Factors for Depression\n\tDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\n\tSeveral factors can play a role in depression:\n\n\tBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.\n\tGenetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.\n\tPersonality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.\n\tEnvironmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.\n\tHow Is Depression Treated?\n\tDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\n\n\tBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"id"=>1, "title"=>"5 Natural Depression Treatments", "content"=>"Being depressed can make you feel helpless. You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves.", "author"=>"R.
