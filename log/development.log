For example, an initial diagnosis of depression was just as likely to be followed by a second diagnosis of anxiety, and vice versa.\n\tImportantly, people who were younger than 20 at the onset of their first mental disorder were significantly more at risk of developing a second disorderover the next 10-15 years, and this vulnerability was found across most pairs of disorders.\n\t\"We found that in younger people, mental health disorders were more \"pluripotent\", meaning an observed change or disruption in mental health was more flexible in the direction it manifested as a disorder,\" Professor McGrath said.\n\tNot only is the study the largest and most comprehensive in its field, but its innovative presentation of results has set a new standard for epidemiology (the study of health and disease data), said Professor McGrath.\n\t\"The paper is open access, with all data available and code free to download, and results presented in an interactive website with educational videos,\" he said.\n\t\"It is far more user-friendly than the traditional method of presenting results purely in an academic paper.\"\n\t\"We have provided a detailed, comprehensive atlas of the ways that mental disorders cluster together available openly for public use, and we hope that this informs better practice, better clinical care, and future research.\"\n\tThe next step for Professor McGrath and his colleagues is to extend the study to identify the risks between mental disorders and the subsequent onset of general medical conditions, such as epilepsy, migraine, heart attacks, and diabetes.\n\tThe paper was published in JAMA Psychiatry and supported by the Danish National Research Foundation."], ["created_at", "2019-01-29 20:54:51.854860"], ["updated_at", "2019-01-29 20:54:51.854860"], ["author", "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190117090515.htm"]]

You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves."], ["created_at", "2019-01-29 20:54:51.858271"], ["updated_at", "2019-01-29 20:54:51.858271"], ["author", "R. Morgan Griffin"]]

Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\n\n\tDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n\tFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\tChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\tLoss of energy or increased fatigue\n\tIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\n\tFeeling worthless or guilty\n\tDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\tThoughts of death or suicide\n\tSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\n\n\tAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\n\n\tDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.\n\n\tDepression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\n\tThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\n\n\tBut being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:\n\n\tIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.\n\tIn grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.\n\tFor some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.\n\tRisk Factors for Depression\n\tDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\n\tSeveral factors can play a role in depression:\n\n\tBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.\n\tGenetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.\n\tPersonality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.\n\tEnvironmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.\n\tHow Is Depression Treated?\n\tDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\n\n\tBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"title"=>"CRISIS & RECOGNITION", "content"=>"Although twenty percent of children and twenty-five percent of adults  have experienced a mental health disorder at some point in their lives, most families are unprepared for the turmoil and stress that can occur when mental illness hits home.   Confusion, sadness, anger and despair are normal responses to the discovery that someone you love has a mental illness.  The good news is that effective treatments exist for even the most serious mental illnesses.  The sooner you recognize that a mental health problem exists and act to treat it, the better the outcomes and prospects for recovery.\n\nSAFETY FIRST.

For example, an initial diagnosis of depression was just as likely to be followed by a second diagnosis of anxiety, and vice versa.\n\tImportantly, people who were younger than 20 at the onset of their first mental disorder were significantly more at risk of developing a second disorderover the next 10-15 years, and this vulnerability was found across most pairs of disorders.\n\t\"We found that in younger people, mental health disorders were more \"pluripotent\", meaning an observed change or disruption in mental health was more flexible in the direction it manifested as a disorder,\" Professor McGrath said.\n\tNot only is the study the largest and most comprehensive in its field, but its innovative presentation of results has set a new standard for epidemiology (the study of health and disease data), said Professor McGrath.\n\t\"The paper is open access, with all data available and code free to download, and results presented in an interactive website with educational videos,\" he said.\n\t\"It is far more user-friendly than the traditional method of presenting results purely in an academic paper.\"\n\t\"We have provided a detailed, comprehensive atlas of the ways that mental disorders cluster together available openly for public use, and we hope that this informs better practice, better clinical care, and future research.\"\n\tThe next step for Professor McGrath and his colleagues is to extend the study to identify the risks between mental disorders and the subsequent onset of general medical conditions, such as epilepsy, migraine, heart attacks, and diabetes.\n\tThe paper was published in JAMA Psychiatry and supported by the Danish National Research Foundation."], ["created_at", "2019-02-05 00:14:10.699352"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-05 00:14:10.699352"], ["author", "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190117090515.htm"], ["image", "https://images.pexels.com/photos/326055/pexels-photo-326055.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500"]]

You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves."], ["created_at", "2019-02-05 00:14:10.702122"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-05 00:14:10.702122"], ["author", "R.

Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\n\n\tDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n\tFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\tChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\tLoss of energy or increased fatigue\n\tIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\n\tFeeling worthless or guilty\n\tDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\tThoughts of death or suicide\n\tSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\n\n\tAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\n\n\tDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.\n\n\tDepression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\n\tThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\n\n\tBut being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:\n\n\tIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.\n\tIn grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.\n\tFor some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.\n\tRisk Factors for Depression\n\tDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\n\tSeveral factors can play a role in depression:\n\n\tBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.\n\tGenetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.\n\tPersonality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.\n\tEnvironmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.\n\tHow Is Depression Treated?\n\tDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\n\n\tBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

For example, an initial diagnosis of depression was just as likely to be followed by a second diagnosis of anxiety, and vice versa.\n\tImportantly, people who were younger than 20 at the onset of their first mental disorder were significantly more at risk of developing a second disorderover the next 10-15 years, and this vulnerability was found across most pairs of disorders.\n\t\"We found that in younger people, mental health disorders were more \"pluripotent\", meaning an observed change or disruption in mental health was more flexible in the direction it manifested as a disorder,\" Professor McGrath said.\n\tNot only is the study the largest and most comprehensive in its field, but its innovative presentation of results has set a new standard for epidemiology (the study of health and disease data), said Professor McGrath.\n\t\"The paper is open access, with all data available and code free to download, and results presented in an interactive website with educational videos,\" he said.\n\t\"It is far more user-friendly than the traditional method of presenting results purely in an academic paper.\"\n\t\"We have provided a detailed, comprehensive atlas of the ways that mental disorders cluster together available openly for public use, and we hope that this informs better practice, better clinical care, and future research.\"\n\tThe next step for Professor McGrath and his colleagues is to extend the study to identify the risks between mental disorders and the subsequent onset of general medical conditions, such as epilepsy, migraine, heart attacks, and diabetes.\n\tThe paper was published in JAMA Psychiatry and supported by the Danish National Research Foundation."], ["created_at", "2019-02-05 00:17:49.607653"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-05 00:17:49.607653"], ["author", "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190117090515.htm"], ["image", "https://images.pexels.com/photos/326055/pexels-photo-326055.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=500"]]

You are not. Along with therapy and sometimes medication, there is a lot you can do on your own to fight back. Changing your behavior -- your physical activity, lifestyle, and even your way of thinking -- are all natural depression treatments.\n\tThese tips can help you feel better -- starting right now. 1. Get in a routine. If you’re depressed, you need a routine, says Ian Cook, MD. He is a psychiatrist and director of the Depression Research and Clinic Program at UCLA.\n\tDepression can strip away the structure from your life. One day melts into the next. Setting a gentle daily schedule can help you get back on track.\n\t2.Set goals. When you are depressed, you may feel like you cannot accomplish anything. That makes you feel worse about yourself. To push back, set daily goals for yourself.\n\t\"Start very small,\" Cook says. \"Make your goal something that you can succeed at, like doing the dishes every other day.\"\n\tYOU MIGHT LIKE\n\tAs you start to feel better, you can add more challenging daily goals.\n\t3. Exercise. It temporarily boosts feel-good chemicals called endorphins. It may also have long-term benefits for people with depression. Regular exercise seems to encourage the brain to rewire itself in positive ways, Cook says.\n\tHow much exercise do you need? You don’t need to run marathons to get a benefit. Just walking a few times a week can help.\n\t4. Eat healthy. There is no magic diet that fixes depression. It is a good idea to watch what you eat, though. If depression tends to make you overeat, getting in control of your eating will help you feel better.\n\tAlthough nothing is definitive, Cook says there is evidence that foods with omega-3 fatty acids (such as salmon and tuna) and folic acid (such as spinach and avocado) could help ease depression.\n\t5. Get enough sleep. Depression can make it hard to get enough shut-eye, and too little sleep can make depression worse.\n\tWhat can you do? Start by making some changes to your lifestyle. Go to bed and get up at the same time every day. Try not to nap. Take all the distractions out of your bedroom -- no computer and no TV. In time, you may find your sleep improves."], ["created_at", "2019-02-05 00:17:49.610874"], ["updated_at", "2019-02-05 00:17:49.610874"], ["author", "R.

Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a person’s ability to function at work and at home.\n\n\tDepression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:\n\n\tFeeling sad or having a depressed mood\n\tLoss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed\n\tChanges in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting\n\tTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\n\tLoss of energy or increased fatigue\n\tIncrease in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)\n\tFeeling worthless or guilty\n\tDifficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions\n\tThoughts of death or suicide\n\tSymptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.\n\n\tAlso, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.\n\n\tDepression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7%) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6%) will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.\n\n\tDepression Is Different From Sadness or Grief/Bereavement\n\tThe death of a loved one, loss of a job or the ending of a relationship are difficult experiences for a person to endure. It is normal for feelings of sadness or grief to develop in response to such situations. Those experiencing loss often might describe themselves as being “depressed.”\n\n\tBut being sad is not the same as having depression. The grieving process is natural and unique to each individual and shares some of the same features of depression. Both grief and depression may involve intense sadness and withdrawal from usual activities. They are also different in important ways:\n\n\tIn grief, painful feelings come in waves, often intermixed with positive memories of the deceased. In major depression, mood and/or interest (pleasure) are decreased for most of two weeks.\n\tIn grief, self-esteem is usually maintained. In major depression, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common.\n\tFor some people, the death of a loved one can bring on major depression. Losing a job or being a victim of a physical assault or a major disaster can lead to depression for some people. When grief and depression co-exist, the grief is more severe and lasts longer than grief without depression. Despite some overlap between grief and depression, they are different. Distinguishing between them can help people get the help, support or treatment they need.\n\tRisk Factors for Depression\n\tDepression can affect anyone—even a person who appears to live in relatively ideal circumstances.\n\n\tSeveral factors can play a role in depression:\n\n\tBiochemistry: Differences in certain chemicals in the brain may contribute to symptoms of depression.\n\tGenetics: Depression can run in families. For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other has a 70 percent chance of having the illness sometime in life.\n\tPersonality: People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, or who are generally pessimistic appear to be more likely to experience depression.\n\tEnvironmental factors: Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse or poverty may make some people more vulnerable to depression.\n\tHow Is Depression Treated?\n\tDepression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.\n\n\tBefore a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms, medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.\n\n\tMedication: Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.\n\n\tAntidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience side effects.\n\n\tPsychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people at high risk.\n\n\tPsychotherapy: Psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.\n\n\tPsychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.\n\n\tDepending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.\n\n\tElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.\n\n\t        \n\n\tSelf-help and Coping\n\tThere are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.\n\n\tDepression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing mental health needs.\n\n\tRelated Conditions\n\tPeripartum depression (previously postpartum depression)\n\tSeasonal depression (Also called seasonal affective disorder)\n\tPersistent depressive disorder (previously dysthymia)\n\tPremenstrual dysphoric disorder\n\tDisruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\tBipolar disorders\n\tReferences\n\tAmerican Psychiatric Association.

  Parameters: {"article"=>{"title"=>"6 Ways Social Media Affects Our Mental Health", "content"=>"Health experts love to say that sitting is the new smoking. Given the number of diseases to which sitting is linked, and the number of people it apparently kills every year, sitting is one of the worst things we can do for health. But possibly as concerning is the thing that we often do while we're sitting: Mindlessly scrolling through our social media feeds when we have a few spare minutes (or for some, hours). And as we probably know intuitively, and as the research is confirming, it's not the best habit when it comes to our collective psychology. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned about the potential for negative effects of social media in young kids and teens, including cyber-bullying and \"Facebook depression.\" But the same risks may be true for adults, across generations. Here's a quick run-down of the studies that have shown that social media isn't very good for mental well-being, and in some ways, it can be pretty damaging.\n\nIt’s addictive\nExperts have not been in total agreement on whether internet addiction is a real thing, let alone social media addiction, but there’s some good evidence that both may exist. A review study from Nottingham Trent University looked back over earlier research on the psychological characteristics, personality and social media use. The authors conclude that “it may be plausible to speak specifically of ‘Facebook Addiction Disorder’…because addiction criteria, such as neglect of personal life, mental preoccupation, escapism, mood modifying experiences, tolerance and concealing the addictive behavior, appear to be present in some people who use [social networks] excessively.” (They also found that the motivation for people’s excessive use of social networks differs depending on certain traits—introverts and extroverts use it for different reasons, as do people with narcissistic traits. But that deserves a piece of its own.)\n\nAnd studies have confirmed that people tend to undergo a kind of withdrawal: A study a few years ago from Swansea University found that people experienced the psychological symptoms of withdrawal when they stopped using (this went for all internet use, not just social media). Their recent follow-up study found that when people stop using, they also undergo small but measurable physiological effects. Study author Phil Reed said, “We have known for some time that people who are over-dependent on digital devices report feelings of anxiety when they are stopped from using them, but now we can see that these psychological effects are accompanied by actual physiological changes.” Whether this is true of social media per se is unclear right now, but anecdotal evidence suggests it may be.\n\nIt triggers more sadness, less well-being\nThe more we use social media, the less happy we seem to be. One study a few years ago found that Facebook use was linked to both less moment-to-moment happiness and less life satisfaction—the more people used Facebook in a day, the more these two variables dropped off. The authors suggest this may have to do with the fact that Facebook conjures up a perception of social isolation, in a way that other solitary activities don’t. “On the surface,” the authors write, “Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling such needs by allowing people to instantly connect. Rather than enhancing well-being, as frequent interactions with supportive 'offline' social networks powerfully do, the current findings demonstrate that interacting with Facebook may predict the opposite result for young adults—it may undermine it.”\n\nIn fact, another study found that social media use is linked to greater feelings of social isolation. The team looked at how much people used 11 social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, Snapchat and Reddit, and correlated this with their “perceived social isolation.” Not surprisingly, it turned out that the more time people spent on these sites, the more socially isolated they perceived themselves to be. And perceived social isolation is one of the worst things for us, mentally and physically.\n\nComparing our lives with others is mentally unhealthy\nPart of the reason Facebook makes people feel socially isolated (even though they may not actually be) is the comparison factor. We fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others as we scroll through our feeds, and make judgements about how we measure up. One study looked at how we make comparisons to others posts, in “upward” or “downward” directions—that is, feeling that we’re either better or worse off than our friends. It turned out that both types of comparisons made people feel worse, which is surprising, since in real life, only upward comparisons (feeling another person has it better than you) makes people feel bad. But in the social network world, it seems that any kind of comparison is linked to depressive symptoms.\n\nIt can lead to jealousy—and a vicious cycle\nIt’s no secret that the comparison factor in social media leads to jealousy—most people will admit that seeing other people’s tropical vacations and perfectly behaved kids is envy-inducing. Studies have certainly shown that social media use triggers feelings of jealousy. The authors of one study, looking at jealousy and other negative feelings while using Facebook, wrote that “This magnitude of envy incidents taking place on FB alone is astounding, providing evidence that FB offers a breeding ground for invidious feelings.\n\nThey add that it can become a vicious cycle: feeling jealous can make a person want to make his or her own life look better, and post jealousy-inducing posts of their own, in an endless circle of one-upping and feeling jealous. Another study looked at the connection between envy and depression in Facebook use and, interestingly, discovered that envy mediates the Facebook-depression link. That is, when envy is controlled for, Facebook isn’t so depressing. So it may be the envy that’s largely to blame in the depression-Facebook connection.\n\nWe get caught in the delusion of thinking it will help\nPart of the unhealthy cycle is that we keep coming back to social media, even though it doesn’t make us feel very good. This is probably because of what’s known as a forecasting error: Like a drug, we think getting a fix will help, but it actually makes us feel worse, which comes down to an error in our ability to predict our own response. One study looked at how people feel after using Facebook and how they think they’ll feel going in. Like other studies suggested, the participants in this one almost always felt worse after using it, compared to people engaging in other activities. But a follow-up experiment showed that people generally believed that they’d feel better after using, not worse. Which of course turns out not to be the case at all, and sounds a lot like the pattern in other types of addiction.\n\nMore friends on social doesn’t mean you’re more social\nA couple of years ago, a study found that more friends on social media doesn’t necessarily mean you have a better social life—there seems to be a cap on the number of friends a person’s brain can handle, and it takes actual social interaction (not virtual) to keep up these friendships. So feeling like you’re being social by being on Facebook doesn’t work.

Given the number of diseases to which sitting is linked, and the number of people it apparently kills every year, sitting is one of the worst things we can do for health. But possibly as concerning is the thing that we often do while we're sitting: Mindlessly scrolling through our social media feeds when we have a few spare minutes (or for some, hours). And as we probably know intuitively, and as the research is confirming, it's not the best habit when it comes to our collective psychology. The American Academy of Pediatrics has warned about the potential for negative effects of social media in young kids and teens, including cyber-bullying and \"Facebook depression.\" But the same risks may be true for adults, across generations. Here's a quick run-down of the studies that have shown that social media isn't very good for mental well-being, and in some ways, it can be pretty damaging.\n\nIt’s addictive\nExperts have not been in total agreement on whether internet addiction is a real thing, let alone social media addiction, but there’s some good evidence that both may exist. A review study from Nottingham Trent University looked back over earlier research on the psychological characteristics, personality and social media use. The authors conclude that “it may be plausible to speak specifically of ‘Facebook Addiction Disorder’…because addiction criteria, such as neglect of personal life, mental preoccupation, escapism, mood modifying experiences, tolerance and concealing the addictive behavior, appear to be present in some people who use [social networks] excessively.” (They also found that the motivation for people’s excessive use of social networks differs depending on certain traits—introverts and extroverts use it for different reasons, as do people with narcissistic traits. But that deserves a piece of its own.)\n\nAnd studies have confirmed that people tend to undergo a kind of withdrawal: A study a few years ago from Swansea University found that people experienced the psychological symptoms of withdrawal when they stopped using (this went for all internet use, not just social media). Their recent follow-up study found that when people stop using, they also undergo small but measurable physiological effects. Study author Phil Reed said, “We have known for some time that people who are over-dependent on digital devices report feelings of anxiety when they are stopped from using them, but now we can see that these psychological effects are accompanied by actual physiological changes.” Whether this is true of social media per se is unclear right now, but anecdotal evidence suggests it may be.\n\nIt triggers more sadness, less well-being\nThe more we use social media, the less happy we seem to be. One study a few years ago found that Facebook use was linked to both less moment-to-moment happiness and less life satisfaction—the more people used Facebook in a day, the more these two variables dropped off. The authors suggest this may have to do with the fact that Facebook conjures up a perception of social isolation, in a way that other solitary activities don’t. “On the surface,” the authors write, “Facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling such needs by allowing people to instantly connect. Rather than enhancing well-being, as frequent interactions with supportive 'offline' social networks powerfully do, the current findings demonstrate that interacting with Facebook may predict the opposite result for young adults—it may undermine it.”\n\nIn fact, another study found that social media use is linked to greater feelings of social isolation. The team looked at how much people used 11 social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Vine, Snapchat and Reddit, and correlated this with their “perceived social isolation.” Not surprisingly, it turned out that the more time people spent on these sites, the more socially isolated they perceived themselves to be. And perceived social isolation is one of the worst things for us, mentally and physically.\n\nComparing our lives with others is mentally unhealthy\nPart of the reason Facebook makes people feel socially isolated (even though they may not actually be) is the comparison factor. We fall into the trap of comparing ourselves to others as we scroll through our feeds, and make judgements about how we measure up. One study looked at how we make comparisons to others posts, in “upward” or “downward” directions—that is, feeling that we’re either better or worse off than our friends. It turned out that both types of comparisons made people feel worse, which is surprising, since in real life, only upward comparisons (feeling another person has it better than you) makes people feel bad. But in the social network world, it seems that any kind of comparison is linked to depressive symptoms.\n\nIt can lead to jealousy—and a vicious cycle\nIt’s no secret that the comparison factor in social media leads to jealousy—most people will admit that seeing other people’s tropical vacations and perfectly behaved kids is envy-inducing. Studies have certainly shown that social media use triggers feelings of jealousy. The authors of one study, looking at jealousy and other negative feelings while using Facebook, wrote that “This magnitude of envy incidents taking place on FB alone is astounding, providing evidence that FB offers a breeding ground for invidious feelings.\n\nThey add that it can become a vicious cycle: feeling jealous can make a person want to make his or her own life look better, and post jealousy-inducing posts of their own, in an endless circle of one-upping and feeling jealous. Another study looked at the connection between envy and depression in Facebook use and, interestingly, discovered that envy mediates the Facebook-depression link. That is, when envy is controlled for, Facebook isn’t so depressing. So it may be the envy that’s largely to blame in the depression-Facebook connection.\n\nWe get caught in the delusion of thinking it will help\nPart of the unhealthy cycle is that we keep coming back to social media, even though it doesn’t make us feel very good. This is probably because of what’s known as a forecasting error: Like a drug, we think getting a fix will help, but it actually makes us feel worse, which comes down to an error in our ability to predict our own response. One study looked at how people feel after using Facebook and how they think they’ll feel going in. Like other studies suggested, the participants in this one almost always felt worse after using it, compared to people engaging in other activities. But a follow-up experiment showed that people generally believed that they’d feel better after using, not worse. Which of course turns out not to be the case at all, and sounds a lot like the pattern in other types of addiction.\n\nMore friends on social doesn’t mean you’re more social\nA couple of years ago, a study found that more friends on social media doesn’t necessarily mean you have a better social life—there seems to be a cap on the number of friends a person’s brain can handle, and it takes actual social interaction (not virtual) to keep up these friendships. So feeling like you’re being social by being on Facebook doesn’t work. Since loneliness is linked to myriad health and mental health problems (including early death), getting real social support is important. Virtual friend time doesn’t have the therapeutic effect as time with real friends.\n\nAll of this is not to say that there’s no benefit to social media—obviously it keeps us connected across great distances, and helps us find people we’d lost touch with years ago.
