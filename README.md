*About*

Mental Health is a project that focuses on user's mental health, resources they can connect to, and where they can go to help.

Users can also create an account and write their own articles and experiences. 

Mental Health is a project that I built with React and Redux in the Front-end with a Rails API. This repository is the front-end of my application. The application was created using Create-React-App, and uses ES6 standards.

*Install Directions*

To see the application in browser, clone both back-end and front-end repositories. The back-end repository can be found here: . 
Run db:migrate and rails s in the api folder in the terminal, and npm install and npm start in the client folder in the terminal.
