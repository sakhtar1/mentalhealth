# Mental Health

*About*

Mental Health is a project that focuses on user's mental health, resources they can connect to, and where they can go to for help.

 Users can also create an account and write their own articles and experiences. 

 Mental Health is a project that I built with React and Redux in the Front-end with a Rails API. This repository is the front-end and back-end of my application. The application was created using Create-React-App, and uses ES6 standards.

 *Install Directions*

To see the application in browser:

(1) Clone this Repository
(2) Run 'bundle install'
(3) Run 'rake db:migrate'
(4) Run 'rake db:seed'
(5) cd into "cd client"
(6) Run 'npm install'
(7) cd back into the main folder run 'cd -'
(8) Run 'rake start'

Your application should be running on 'http://localhost:3000'

To checkout the backend data run 'http://localhost:3001/api'.
